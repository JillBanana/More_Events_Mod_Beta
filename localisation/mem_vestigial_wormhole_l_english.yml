 mem_vestigial_wormhole_object: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole_object_desc: "A spatial rift connecting two distant locations. This one has been destabilized beyond recovery - it's unlikely anything could come in or out."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole_wanderer_trait: "Wormhole wanderer"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole_wanderer_trait_desc: "Once trapped inside an unstable wormhole, this intrepid explorer knows quite a lot about space exporation."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! System contains an unusual feature - a §Swormhole§!. \n\nThis one, however, is highly unstable. Perhaps in a distant past it was possible to travel through it to the distant worlds, but now it's near complete collapse. It chaotic nature makes it impossible to travel: it's highly unlikely anything could ever enter or leave it."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.desc: "The wormhole in the §Y[the_system.GetName]§! System had proven to not be as unstable as we thought. \n\nToday, against all odds, an alien ship has emerged from it - unlike any ship we encountered before. This seems to be the final straw - moments later the wormhole has completely collapse. \n\nThe ship appears to be completely inert, slowly drifting through the system."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.a: "We should investigate."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.b: "Blast the intruder out of the sky."

 MEM_VESTIGIAL_WORMHOLE_PROJECT: "Investigate the mysterious ship"
 MEM_VESTIGIAL_WORMHOLE_PROJECT_DESC: "A strange ship has emerged from the vestigial wormhole, before it collapsed. We should board the ship and find out who or what brought it here."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.name: "Surviving Explorer"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports that following the boarding of an unidentified ship that has entered [the_system.GetName] System through a collapsing wormhole, [Leader.GetSheHe] has found something unexpected: a living pilot. \n\nFollowing interrogation revealed the truth: the pilot was a scientist exploring the wormhole when some kind of spatial anomaly destabilized it. Comparison between our star charts and those stored aboard the ship suggests that [the_guy.GetHerHis] journey began several galaxies away, about 2 billions of years ago."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.a: "Offer [the_guy.GetHerHim] a position in our science division."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.b: "We don't need [the_guy.GetHerHis] services."
