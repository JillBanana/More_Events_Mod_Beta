 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! System contains an unusual feature - a §Swormhole§!. \n\nThis one, however, is highly unstable. Perhaps in a distant past it was possible to travel through it to the distant worlds, but now it's near complete collapse. It chaotic nature makes it impossible to travel: it's highly unlikely anything could ever enter or leave it."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.desc: "The wormhole in the §Y[the_system.GetName]§! System had proven to not be as unstable as we thought. \n\nToday, against all odds, an alien ship has emerged from it - unlike any ship we encountered before. This seems to be the final straw - moments later the wormhole has completely collapse. \n\nThe ship appears to be completely inert, slowly drifting through the system."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.a: "We should investigate."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.b: "Blast the intruder out of the sky."

 MEM_VESTIGIAL_WORMHOLE_PROJECT: "Investigate the mysterious ship"

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.name: "Surviving Explorer"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports that following the boarding of an unidentified ship that has entered [the_system.GetName] System through a collapsing wormhole, [Leader.GetSheHe] has found something unexpected: a living pilot. \n\nFollowing interrogation revealed the truth: the pilot was a scientist exploring the wormhole when some kind of spatial anomaly destabilized it. Comparison between our star charts and those stored aboard the ship suggests that [the_guy.GetHerHis] journey began several galaxies away, about 2 billions of years ago."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.psi: "As [Root.GetName] approached the derelict vessel in [Solar_System.GetName] System, [Leader.GetName] has sensed many minds inside. Cold, alien ravenous minds waiting for the prey to come to them. \n\nCloser look revealed that the ship is filled with large and agressive eight-legged creatures. Avoiding an ambush thanks for [Leader.GetHerHis] premonition, [Leader.GetName] wisely opted to retreate and scuttle the ship, in order to contain the biological hazard."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.cyborg: "The derelict vessel in [Solar_System.GetName] System has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures. One of them even managed to get a drop on [Leader.GetName], only to be incirnerated by [Leader.GetHerHis] newly installed personal defence system. \n\nThe crew was forced to retreat, scuttling the ship in process to avoid possible contamination."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.robot: "The derelict vessel in [Solar_System.GetName] System has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures that were, however, unable to penetrate their armour and do any harm. \n\nIn order to avoid possible infestation however, [Leader.GetName] decided to scuttle the ship."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.desc.robust: "The derelict vessel in [Solar_System.GetName] System has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures. One of them even managed to get a drop on [Leader.GetName], but as it bit [Leader.GetHerHim], the augmented immune system identified the threat and proved to be quite deadly to would-be predator. \n\nHowever, unwilling to test [Leader.GetHerHis] luck further, [Leader.GetName] opted to leave and scuttle the ship to prevent further contamination."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.a.psi: "Foresight is hard to overestimate."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.a.cyborg: "Our bug repellent is augmented."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.7.name: "Giant Space Spiders"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.7.desc: "The derelict vessel in [Solar_System.GetName] System has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures. Before they could react, one of the largest attacked [bitten_leader.GetName], attaching itself to [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body and causing [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] to slip into a deep coma. The team had to withdraw, scuttling the ship to avoid further contamination."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.desc: "A month after being bitten, [bitten_leader.GetName] has woken up in a medical facility om [Capital_Scope.GetName]. But they have changed. \n\nTheir old personality is gone, apparently replaced by a giant spider still attached to [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body. Talking through its host, the creature made contact. It calls itself §YEight-Legs§! and claims to be a part of an ancient and advanced species. \n\nWhile admitting to effectively killing [bitten_leader.GetName], it has offered to make up for it by serving our empire in [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] stead."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.desc.hive: "[bitten_leader.GetName] woke up again, but it has changed. We no longer sense [bitten_leader.GetHerHim] as a part of us. \n\nNew, cold and dark mind has taken place inside: a creature calling itself §YEight-Legs§! took over [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body. It offers to serve us now, in exchange for its life. Could we trust it?"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.a: "Accept Eight-Legs in our service."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.name: "Ghost Ship"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully boarding the mysterious ship that appeared out of wormhole in [Solar_System.GetName] System. \n\nWhat [Leader.GetSheHe] and [Leader.GetHerHis] crew found inside is difficult to explain. The ship is clearly designed with an organic crew in mind, no living being or idenitifiable remains were found. The only thing that suggests organics were once there is an empty space suit still strapped to pilot's chair. There is no indication what could've happened to pilot, assuming one even existed in the first place. \n\nThe ship seems to be designed for exploration and can be repurposed as another science vessel."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.a: "Make it so."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.a.tooltip: "We gain a new §S$science$§!"
