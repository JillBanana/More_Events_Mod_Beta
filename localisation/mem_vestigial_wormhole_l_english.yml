 mem_vestigial_wormhole_object: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole_object_desc: "A spatial rift connecting two distant locations. This one has been destabilized beyond recovery - it's unlikely anything could come in or out."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole_ship_object: "Unknown Ship"

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! System contains an unusual feature - a §Swormhole§!. \n\nThis one, however, is highly unstable. Perhaps in a distant past it was possible to travel through it to the distant worlds, but now it's near complete collapse. It chaotic nature makes it impossible to travel: it's highly unlikely anything could ever enter or leave it."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.desc: "The wormhole in the §Y[the_system.GetName]§! System had proven to not be as unstable as we thought. \n\nToday, against all odds, an alien ship has emerged from it - unlike any ship we encountered before. This seems to be the final straw - moments later the wormhole has completely collapse. \n\nThe ship appears to be completely inert, slowly drifting through the system."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.a: "We should investigate."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.b: "Blast the intruder out of the sky."
