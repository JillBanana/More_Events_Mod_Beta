 mem_hithere.1.name:0 "Strange signal"
 mem_hithere.1.desc:0 "Our radio equipment on planet [Root.GetName] has picked up a transmission. Unlike technology available to us, it uses simple electro-magnetic waves to carry information at the speed of light. The signal is faint from travelling for years through vast distance, but is looped, so we should be able to reconstruct and decypher it with ease."
 mem_hithere.1a:0 "They have nothing interesting to say. Delete"
 
 mem_hithere.2.name:0 "Recorded message"
 mem_hithere.2.desc:0 "Hi there! This is professor Wukka Zaor, of Valintu Extrasolar Intelligence Institute speaking. \n\nWe are sending this message across the galaxy in hope of reaching our brothers in intelligence. We do not have technology to travel between the stars, but we hope that you can. \n\nBy the time this message will reach you, all of us who participated in its recording will likely be dead, but we are hopeful that you will honour our descendants with your visit. \n\nI know, our civilization is far from perfect, but still, we hope that we could find ground for mutual understanding and learn from each other. \n\nWe refuse to believe that the universe is cold and empty. We dream of the day we meet. Coordinates of our home system attached to this message. \n\nEthernally yours, people of Valin."
 mem_hithere.2a:0 "Maybe we will check up on them"
 mem_hithere.2a.phile:0 "Onwards, towards new friends!"
 mem_hithere.2a.phobe:0 "It would be prudent to see if they are a threat"
 mem_hithere.2a.swarm:0 "More food... yes..."
 mem_hithere.2a.pur:0 "Looks like our hitlist just grown"
 
 mem_hithere.3.name:0 "Valin Prime"
 mem_hithere.3.desc:0 "We have arrived to the home system of Valintu species. However their home world appears to be experiencing the aftermath of large-scale nuclear bombing. The planet is irradiated and devastated, with no signs of life visible. It appears that between sending out a message and us receiving it, Valintu civilization got completely oblitirated by internal or external conflict."
 mem_hithere.3a.phobe:0 "And nothing of value was lost."
 mem_hithere.3a.swarm:0 "Our food! No!"
 mem_hithere.3a.pur:0 "Somebody stole our kill. Shame."

 mem_hithere_building:0 "Extrasolar Intelligence Institute"
 mem_hithere_building_desc:0 "Once hundreds of planet's greatest minds were working here looking for alien intelligence. Now all that is left is ruins... and a vast underground data archive."
 
 mem_hithere_poi:0 "Valin Prime"
 mem_hithere_poi_desc:0 "Somebody had send out a message trying to reach alien intelligence. Perhaps we should pay them a visit."
 
 mem_hithere.4.name:0 "Outer moon telescope"
 mem_hithere.4.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! had detected a grid of pilons, well preserved by vacuum of space, on §Y[From.GetName]§!, barren sister moon of Valin. From the look of it, Valintu dedicated considerable effort towards building a highly sophisticated radio telescope looking for signals from alien civilizations."
 
 mem_hithere.5.name:0 "Gas giant transmitter array"
 mem_hithere.5.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§!, a gas giant orbited by §YVolin§! still has a massive artificial structure orbiting it. It is badly damaged by space debris, but its purpose is clear - a large orbital antennas were used to send radiowaves into space. This is likely an origin point for the signal we received."
 
 mem_hithere.6.name:0 "Exploration rovers"
 mem_hithere.6.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! detected multiple autonomous rovers and debris from landing modules still present on §Y[From.GetName]§!. It appears Volintu civilization had dedicated considerable effort to explore the barren planet by their primitive means. Some rovers are even still operational, aimlessly moving around and performing pointless tests."

mem_hithere.7.name:0 "Captured probe"
mem_hithere.7.desc:0 "During the survey of §Y[From.GetName]§!, the outermost planet in Volintu home system, §Y[Root.GetName]§! had detected a small probe. It seems that beside the signal Volintu sent out at least one probe with plaque describing their civilization and how to find it, that has consequently been captured by the gravity of the planet."
