Despite its advanced age, it still seems to be operational, even if at half the capacity. \n\nLifesigns detected inside indicate presence of numerous small creatures. Though they do not posesses true sapience, they appear to be bred, or genetically engineered to have instinctive understanding of complex machinery. Besides a few collapsed sections, they kept station livable for a long period of time, presumably waiting for rightful owners to arrive and claim the habitat. \n\nWe might be able to uplift these lesser beings, with the right technology."
