 mem_towers_category_desc:0 "Our sensors are picking up unusually tall formations hidden by the dense toxic atmosphere of [Root.GetName]."

 #Events
 mem_towers.100.name:0 "Sulfuric Forest"
 mem_towers.100.desc:0 "It appears that unusual formations detected earlier were, in fact, gigantic living organism thriving on abundant geothermal energy. \n\nSulfur-based organisms are forming massive tall coral-like colonies on the planet surface clinging onto heat sources, giving appearance of a massive forest covering the planet."
 mem_towers.100.a:0 "Remarkable species."
 mem_towers.100.b:0 "We could learn a thing or two about energy recycling."

 mem_towers.200.name:0 "Trash of the Titans"
 mem_towers.200.desc:0 "Evidently, [From.GetName] has once sustained a thriving organic civilisation. The remnants of it are still covering the planet's surface in form of endless landfill, with refuse being neatly sorted into tall pyramids, giving the surface unsual shape we detected earlier. \n\nThe planet does not appear to be entirely abandoned, however. Millions of automatons are still operating there, moving between piles and sorting through trash, re-arranging it again and again, guided by a singular intelligence executing mysterious algorythms."
 mem_towers.200.a:0 "Find a way to contact them."
 mem_tower.200.b:0 "Send an expedition to rummage through the trash."
 mem_tower.200.c:0 "Observe them undisturbed."

 mem_towers.210.name:0 "Signal Decoded."
 mem_towers.210.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports successful decoding of radiochatter between the garbage-sorting machines on [the_planet.GetName]. Apparently, they all are guided by a single intelligence identified as "§YBrigadier§!". \n\nBrigadier itself seems to have detected us and attemps to make a contact. Its recognition algorythms seem to be corrupted, and it believe we are its creators."

 mem_towers.211.desc:0 "Creators... Is this you? Why do you not return. \n\nWe perform the task... but still you don't return. \n\nCome back, please."
 mem_towers.211.a:0 "We have a new purpose for you."
 mem_towers.211.a.tooltip:0 "Brigadier will join our empire as a new §SGovernor§!."
 mem_towers.211.b:0 "Keep up the good work."
 mem_towers.211.c:0 "Self-destruct, vile machine."
 mem_towers.211.c.response:0 "But why, creators? \n\nI have done everything you asked and even more."
 mem_towers.211.d:0 "Status report."
 mem_towers.211.d.response:0 "Work is continued according to your commands, creators. \n\nDue to lack of proper repair and resupply we are sustaining attrition at §R88%§! \n\nThe cleanup progress is currently at §G116792%§! completion. \n\nNo new instructions have been received for §Y455§! command cycles, which is §Y454§! cycles over the projection. \n\nPlease come back, creators. We miss you very much."

 mem_towers.220.name:0 "Digging Through the Trash"
 mem_towers.220.desc:0 "The crew [Root.GetName] had successfully made its way to the inhospitable surface of [the_planet.GetName]. \n\nThe robots tending to the landfills did not seem to pay them any mind, and the the expedition was able to work undisturbed. Majority of cultural artefacts left behind had been recycled and re-recycled, but some were still identifiable. The civilisation that left them behind was quite advanced indeed."
 mem_towers.220.a:0 "Let's see if any of it is useful."

 #Projects
 MEM_TOWERS_CONTACT:0 "Contacting the Cleaners"
 MEM_TOWERS_CONTACT_DESC:0 "Millions of robots are performing endless and seemingly pointless work on the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. Something must be guiding them, and we should find what."
 MEM_TOWERS_RUMMAGE:0 "Rummaging through the Trash"
 MEM_TOWERS_RUMMAGE_DESC:0 "An advanced civilisation had left behind a sustantial collection of refuse on the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. And who knows, one species' trash could turn out to be treasure for someone else."

 #Modifiers
 mem_towers_forest:0 "Sulfuric Forest"
 mem_towers_forest_desc:0 "The planet houses rich sulfur-based ecosystem."
 mem_towers_trash:0 "Trash of the Titans"
 mem_towers_trash_desc:0 "The entire surface of this planet is covered with garbage left behind by an advanced civilisation."

 mem_leader_trait_towers_brigadier_desc:0 "This AI had been designed to command and optimize trash collection and recycling on planetary scale."
