 mem_refuel_category_desc:0 "Scans are detecting a cloud of unidentified substance spreading through the gas giant's upper atmosphere. Chemical composition, radioactive signature and high energy density suggest advanced starship fuel..."

 mem_refuel.1.name:0 "Abandoned Refueling Station"
 mem_refuel.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] was able to trace the fuel cloud around [From.GetName] to its source - old space station of unknown origin. \n\n[Leader.GetName] estimates station age to be at least 400 years, believing that it was safely conserved for the most of that time, but recently experienced an asteroid collision that destabilised its orbit and breached its main storage tank. All things considered, this station will not last long, and neither will its precious content."
 mem_refuel.1.a:0 "Syphone the fuel into [Root.GetName]."
 mem_refuel.1.a.tooltip:0 "§RPumping fuel from unknown source might be dangerous...§!"
 mem_refuel.1.b:0 "Track the fuel cloud for future recovery."
 mem_refuel.1.c:0 "Find a way to save the station for future study."
 mem_refuel.1.d:0 "Take this opportunity to study the station."
 mem_refuel.1.e:0 "Keep away. It's not worth the risk."
 
 mem_refuel.2.name:0 "No Such Thing As Free Fuel"
 mem_refuel.2.desc:0 "We are receiving a distress call from [Root.GetName]. It appears that the fuel it obtained on [FROMFROM.GetName] had destabilised its systems causing catastrophic failure and inevitable explosion. \n\nIt looks like using a fuel from an unknown source without proper testing might not have been the right call."

 mem_refuel.20.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_refuel.20.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has detected a fuel-leaking space station in a decaying orbit of [FROMFROM.GetName], but despite her crew's best effort, she was not able to dock with it for further investigation and was forced to disengage as the station disappeared in denser parts of the gas giant's atmosphere."
 mem_refuel.20.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 
 mem_refuel.30.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_refuel.30.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has detected a fuel-leaking space station in a decaying orbit of [FROMFROM.GetName]. Trying to dock to it for further investigation, however, has proven to be disastrous, and both [Root.GetName] and the station were destroyed in a resulting collision."
