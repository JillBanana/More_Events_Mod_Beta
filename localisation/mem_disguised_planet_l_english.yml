 mem_disguised_planet_category_desc:0 "Atmospheric patterns of this planet do not entirely match simulations, and several deep scans provided data wildly inconsistent with the rest."
 
 mem_disguised_planet.1.name:0 "Holographic disguise"
 mem_disguised_planet.1.desc:0 "Further investigation has revealed that supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] does not actually exists. A clever use of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion had created a convincing illusion that the planet has a thick hostile atmosphere. \n\nOnce the fake clouds have parted, [Root.GetName] had discovered... a completely barren world, concealed beneath the illusion. It seems, someone had gone to a great length to disguise this inhospitable rock as a different kind of inhospitable rock."
 mem_disguised_planet.1.a:0 "What was even the point?"
 
 mem_disguised_planet.2.name:0 "A Hidden World"
 mem_disguised_planet.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] was not toxic at all. \n\nA clever use of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion had created a convincing illusion that the planet has a thick hostile atmosphere, while in reality the atmosphere appears to be quite benign. Once the fake clouds have parted, a habitable surface was revealed beneath. \n\nIt seems, at some point someone had gone to quite a length to disguise this world as something far less hospitable."

 mem_disguised_planet.3.name:0 "Mystery Wrapped in an Enigma"
 mem_disguised_planet.3.desc:0 "Further investigation has revealed that supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] does not actually exists. A clever use of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion had created a convincing illusion that the planet has a thick hostile atmosphere. \n\nWhat [Root.GetName] actually discovered beneath beneath the fake clouds was quite odd - a tiny planet covered entirely in a shield, which appears to be completely impenetrable itself, so it remains completely unclear who and for what purpose had decided to not only encase a planet in a shield, but cover it up with fake atmosphere as well..."
 mem_disguised_planet.3.a:0 "Very odd."
 
 mem_disguised_planet.100.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_disguised_planet.100.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] could not replicate previous anomalous readings on [FromFrom.GetName]. Most likely, they were caused by improperly calibrated sensors."
 mem_disguised_planet.100.a:0 "Disappointing,"
 
 mem_disguised_planet_modifier:0 "Holographic projectors"
 mem_disguised_planet_modifier_desc:0 "Ancient holographic projectors produce false image of toxic clouds over this world."
 
 mem_disguised_planet_pile:0 "Mystery Pile"
 mem_disguised_planet_pile_desc:0 "It's unclear what exactly is this pile, except that it is composed of highly complex polymers, is painful to look at and smells foul. It also wobbles."
