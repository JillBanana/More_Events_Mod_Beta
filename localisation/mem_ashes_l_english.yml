 mem_ashes_category_desc:0 "Barren surface of [Root.GetName] is completely devoid of life. But this might not have always been the case..."
 
 mem_ashes.999.name:0 "Most Definitely a Barren World"
 mem_ashes.999.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that repeated sweep of [FromFrom.GetName] confirmed complete lack of any signs of life, past or present. \n\nAny indications to the contrary had been proven to be false leads."
 
 mem_ashes.1.name:0 "Beneath the Surface"
 mem_ashes.1.desc:0 "Though the surface of [From.GetName] is blasted by cosmic radiation and completely devoid of life, what lies beneath tells a different story. \n\nIt seems the planet was at some point a home to a moderately advanced pre-spaceflight civilisation, and our explorers had found multiple underground structures, presumably used for storage, transportation and shelter: most importantly a surviving piece of underground rapid transit system, connected to a vast bunker, presumably a fallout shelter. Inside, they discovered large amount of hastly setup primitive stasis pods, still operational and containing aliens in suspended animation. \n\nThe complex is too damaged to reactivate it on site, but we could extract pods and bring them off-world for more convenient examination and possible reactivation."
 mem_ashes.1.a:0 "Bring them home. Perhaps, the aliens can be saved."
 mem_ashes.1.b:0 "Leave the pods in place. We don't have time for this."
 mem_ashes.1.c:0 "Dispose of the helpless aliens."
 
 mem_ashes_underground:0 "Underground Ruins"

 MEM_ASHES_EXTRACT:0 "Extract the Sleeping Pods"
 MEM_ASHES_EXTRACT_DESC:0 "Sleeping pods are clearly hastly constructed with very primitive technology and ravages of time made them even more unreliable. Moving them off-world requires delicacy and precision."
 
 mem_ashes.2.name:0 "Sleeping Pods Retreived"
 mem_ashes.2.desc:0 "We have successfully transferred sleeping pods from [their_planet.GetName] to a secure facility on our home world. Reactivating them might be tricky, but our technology should still let it happen without an incident."
 mem_ashes.2.a:0 "We should consider our options..."
 
 MEM_ASHES_REVIVE:0 "Revive the Sleepers"
 MEM_ASHES_REVIVE_DESC:0 "We can now revive aliens we found on [their_planet.GetName]. The pods are not particularly stable, but we have the technology necessary to work around possible hazards."
 
 MEM_ASHES_AUTOPSY:0 "Sleeper Autopsy"
 MEM_ASHES_AUTOPSY_DESC:0 "There's little need to wake the aliens from [their_planet.GetName] up. Dissecting their still living, frozen bodies would tell us more than any awake conversation."
 
 mem_ashes.3.name:0 "Sleepers Revived"
 mem_ashes.3.desc:0 "It took us some considerable effort to successfully activate revival protocols in sleeper pods from planet [their_planet.GetName]. As the translation software was calibrated, survivors were able to share their story... \n\nThey call themselves [their_species.GetName]. Their species had advanced to the early space age, but soon before they were able to launch their first satellite, they had discovered abnormal activity on their sun. In anticipation of a cataclysmic solar flare, their governments had secretly arranged to use old fallout shelters to store the best and brightest of their society using primitive crionic technology. \n\nThe plan was to revive them to start a new civilization once the danger has passed, but the flare was far more severe than any could anticipated. \n\nWith entire surface of the planet sterelized and atmosphere blown away, all-clear signal was never received and pods were left to degrade, until the last surviving pod was recovered by our researchers. \n\nBut now, as sleepers had awoken and acclimatized, we can't keep them in our research facilities forever. A new permanent accomodation needs to be arranged..."
 mem_ashes.3.a:0 "Settle them in our space as part of our empire."
 mem_ashes.3.a.tooltip:0 "§Y[planet_to_colonize.GetName]§! will be colonized by the [their_species.GetName]."
 mem_ashes.3.b:0 "Give them a system and set up a protectorate."
 mem_ashes.3.b.tooltip:0 "§Y[planet_to_colonize.GetName]§! will be colonized by the [their_species.GetName]. [planet_to_colonize.Solar_System.GetName] wil be ceded to them and their country will assume role of our vassal."
 mem_ashes.3.c:0 "Let them settle on our world."
 mem_ashes.3.c.tooltip:0 "The [their_species.GetName] will settle on one of our planets that has free space."

 mem_ashes.4.name:0 "Sleeper Autopsy Complete"
 mem_ashes.4.desc:0 "Our scientists had completed dissection of every last pod inhabitant we found on [their_planet.GetName]. The data obtained is invaluable, but with last survivors of that species finding demise on our examination tables, their kind had been wiped out forever."
 mem_ashes.4.a:0 "That's life."
 
 mem_ashes.6.name:0 "[their_country.GetName]"
 mem_ashes.6.desc:0 "Greetings! Do you remember us? \n\nEven though it is regrettable that you weren't able or willing to offer us a place in your own empire, we did not forget your kindness and will forever be grateful for saving us from that vault. \n\nWe are doing well and already had found a new world for ourselves. One of our leaders, who was instrumental in creating the vault initiative in the first place have expressed wishes to join your empire and provide expertise as a sign of our gratitude. Are you interested?"
 mem_ashes.6.a:0 "Not interested."
 mem_ashes.6.b:0 "Very well."
