 mem_gravekeeper.2:0 "守墓人"
 mem_gravekeeper.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName]上的船員成功取得這座太空站的中央主機權限，科學家[Root.GetLeaderName]相信他們可以突破太空站的保安系統，繼而重新啟動這座設施。"

 mem_gravekeeper.10:0 "Murphy's Fallacy" 
 mem_gravekeeper.10.desc:0 "The activation was a success! The security protocols have been bypassed, and the facility is fully powered and operational. A permanent crew has been garrisoned on the station. Once they have replaced the disabled security systems with our own protocols and established standard engineering control systems we should have full control over the station."

 mem_gravekeeper.41:0 "盜墓者"
 mem_gravekeeper.41.desc:0 "We have managed to disable the weapon in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system. Despite the extensive damage it took from our fleet it appears to still possess the ability to repair. Although it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that if we act with haste its systems can be modified for use with our own fleets. It would certainly make for a powerful tactical asset."
 mem_gravekeeper.41.a:0 "It will make a powerful addition to the fleet."
 mem_gravekeeper.41.b:0 "This "thing" is far too dangerous, take it apart!"

 mem_gravekeeper.50.desc:0 "This is a glorious day! Our engineers have finished their work on the weapon we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system and it has passed all safety tests. While our more cautious engineers hesitate to declare this mysterious technological behemoth to be truly reliable, they agree that it is as safe as any ancient weapon can be. The AI core has been replaced with a new system of our own design, and we are awaiting instruction."
 mem_gravekeeper.50.a:0 "Will we ever know what really happened in that graveyard system?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.60:0 "Dead Rising" 
 mem_gravekeeper.60.desc:0 "Our scientists believe we might be able to unlock the full capabilities of the ancient warship designated as the 'Gravekeeper'. For a price."

 mem_gravekeeper.60.b:0 "It's a waste of resources."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.61:0 "Necropolis"
 mem_gravekeeper.61.desc:0 "Our scientists believe that the ship is now fully operational and ready for deployment; we should be able to use its full capabilities under combat conditions."

 mem_gravekeeper.71.b:0 "Have we learned nothing from tampering with ancient technology?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.72:0 "Overdrive" 
 mem_gravekeeper.72.desc:0 "Our scientists have finished their adjustments to the reactor core of the Gravekeeper; for a short time it should now be possible to go beyond the ships normal limits."

 MEM_GRAVE_PC_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The massive weapon that we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system is still largely intact and in the process of repairing itself. We may be able to reverse engineer its systems and put it into service with our own fleets."
