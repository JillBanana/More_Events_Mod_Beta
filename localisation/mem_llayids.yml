 mem_llayids.1.name:0 "The Ruins of a Civilisation"
 mem_llayids.1.desc:0 "This gas giant's ring appears to be the remains of a series of habitats that once orbited the planet and were destroyed in some cataclysm in the distant past. However, it is not clear what caused this event, as the material remains match none with which we are familiar. [root.leader.GetName] has recommended we establish a research post to study the former inhabitants and what caused their demise. Could it have been a superweapon, the likes of which we can scarcely imagine?"
 mem_llayids.1.desc.hive:0 "This gas giant's ring appears to be the remains of a series of habitats that once orbited the planet and were destroyed in some cataclysm in the distant past. However, it is not clear what caused this event, as the material remains match none which the hive has previously encountered. Perhaps we should establish a research post and set some drones to studying the former inhabitants and what caused their demise. Could it have been a superweapon in action?"
 mem_llayids.1.desc.machine:0 "This gas giant's ring appears to be the remains of a series of habitats that once orbited the planet and were destroyed in some cataclysm in the distant past. However, it is not clear what caused this event, as the material remains cannot be matched with any in our data banks. Perhaps we should establish a research post and set some subroutines to studying the former inhabitants and what caused their demise. Could it have been a superweapon in action?"
 mem_llayids.1.A:0 "How terrible!"
 mem_llayids.1.B:0 "Lets find out more."
 mem_llayids.1.C:0 "A superweapon, you say?"
 mem_llayids.1.purifier:0 "Excellent. The xenos kill each other. Let's just find that weapon..."
 mem_llayids.1.swarm:0 "Excellent. The organics do our job. Let's just find that weapon..."
 mem_llayids.1.terminator:0 "This food has spoiled. Let us see what preparation methods were used."

 mem_llayids.4.desc:0 "Among the various remains of the xeno civilisation that once lived around [fromfrom.GetName], our researchers have found all manner of distasteful xeno artefacts, but no traces of any weapons, let alone a superweapon. As the xeno remains are of no further use to us, research into them has ceased."
 mem_llayids.4.desc.hive:0 "Among the various remains of the xeno civilisation that once lived around [fromfrom.GetName], our seeker drones have found all manner of xeno artefacts, but no traces of any weapons, let alone a superweapon. As the spoilt remains of food are of no further use to us, research into them has ceased."
 mem_llayids.4.desc.machine:0 "Among the various remains of the organic civilisation that once lived around [fromfrom.GetName], our seeker drones have found all manner of remnants, but no traces of any weapons, let alone a superweapon. As we only had interest in the destroyers, not the destroyed (they would have met the same fate had we found them), research into them has ceased."
 mem_llayids.4.A:0 "A pity."
