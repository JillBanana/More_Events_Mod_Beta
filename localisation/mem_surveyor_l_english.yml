 mem_surveyor.100.here.2:0 "Who's there? Oh, that's just you. \n\nWait, who are you? Are you the one in charge of this system or am I thinking of someone else?"

 #Greets based on ethics, governments etc.
 mem_surveyor.100.mat:0 "So, you are materialists, huh? \n\nTell me, how often do you materialize? Once a day? More often? Less?"
 mem_surveyor.100.spi:0 "You are spiritualists, right? What kind of spirits do you like?"

 #Options and replies
 mem_surveyor.100.a:0 "What exactly is your mission?"
 mem_surveyor.100.a.answer:0 "I have been created by §YAlkree Imperium§! with the sole purpose of continued monitoring of the galaxy and hyperlane network. \n\nMy creators were not very interested in the galaxy, but they wanted to know if any threat to their security would arise. I am tasked with collecting relevant data. Mostly demographical and ethnographical, but some astrophysics aspects as well."
 mem_surveyor.100.b:0 "Tell us more about the Alkree."
 mem_surveyor.100.b.answer:0 "Can't tell you much. Wouldn't, even if told you. \n\nThey are a friendly bunch, just not very... social, you know. Don't like to be disturbed. This is where I come in, see?"
 mem_surveyor.100.c:0 "Your masters are dead, you know that?"
 mem_surveyor.100.c.answer:0 "Irrelevant. The mission will continue unless definitive conclusion is reached or explicit recall order dispatched from the homeworld. The conclusion is not reached, the order is not received. The mission continues."
