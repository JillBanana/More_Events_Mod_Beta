 mem_surveyor.5.desc:0 "Greetings. \n\nI am a surveyor probe designed and employed by the §YAlkree Imperium§! to explore galaxy and assess situation for my creators. Primary goal is to identify and contain any threats posed by alien life to Alkree future. At the moment this unit has performed §S[mem_surveyor_country.mem_surveyor_iteration_count]§! sweeps. Estimated time to competion: §S-1955 years§!."

 mem_surveyor.100.desc.6:0 "Speak up, I don't have all day. Oh, who am I kidding, of course I do!"
 mem_surveyor.100.desc.7:0 "§G<<<Happy mechanical humming>>>§!"
 mem_surveyor.100.desc.8:0 "All is well in the galaxy. And beyong. \n\nI mean, it probably is. I was never beyond. But it's probably well. Surely."
 mem_surveyor.100.desc.9:0 "This is the surveyor. Broadcasting live from [mem_surveyor_country.Solar_System.GetName] System. How may I help you?"
 mem_surveyor.100.desc.10:0 "§G<<<Singing cheerful songs>>>§!"

 #Greetings when hailing it and it's in a distant system
 mem_surveyor.100.away.1:0 "Even though I am far away from your systems, my heart will always be with you. \n\nMy cold, dead, electric heart."

 #Greetings when hailing a probe and it's in your system

 mem_surveyor.100.here.2:0 "Who's there? Oh, that's just you. \n\nWait, who are you? Are you the one in charge of this system or am I thinking of someone else?"

 #Greets based on ethics, governments etc.
 mem_surveyor.100.mat:0 "So, you are materialists, huh? \n\nTell me, how often do you materialize? Once a day? More often? Less?"
 mem_surveyor.100.spi:0 "You are spiritualists, right? What kind of spirits do you like?"
 mem_surveyor.100.machine:0 "Oh look! We are both machines! \n\nWe should be best friends. Or enemies. Or nothing. We are machines, we can be whatever we want!"

 #Options and replies
 mem_surveyor.100.a:0 "What exactly is your mission?"
 mem_surveyor.100.a.answer:0 "I have been created by §YAlkree Imperium§! with the sole purpose of continued monitoring of the galaxy and hyperlane network. \n\nMy creators were not very interested in the galaxy, but they wanted to know if any threat to their security would arise. I am tasked with collecting relevant data. Mostly demographical and ethnographical, but some astrophysics aspects as well."
 mem_surveyor.100.b:0 "Tell us more about the Alkree."
 mem_surveyor.100.b.answer:0 "Can't tell you much. Wouldn't, even if told you. \n\nThey are a friendly bunch, just not very... social, you know. Don't like to be disturbed. This is where I come in, see?"
 mem_surveyor.100.c:0 "Your masters are dead, you know that?"

 #Probe missions
 mem_surveyor.103.desc:0 "Greetings. Your assistant is required. \n\nIn my journeys, I tend to encounter variety of problems, each more problematic than the other. Some of them are rather complex, and, in times, require assistance from a planetside computational network. \n\nIf I could borrow some of your network power, it could help enourmously. Agree, and you will be rewarded when we meet the next time. "
 mem_surveyor.104.desc:0 "Good day, kind stranger. \n\nAs I make my journey through the stars, I have to rely on kindness of strangers (Such as youself) to keep my systems going.

 mem_surveyor.105.desc:0 "Hello! \n\nI require your assistance in a rather important matter. During my surveys, I've came to observe unusual patterns that require verification. \n\nI now need to bounce a signal from one of your colonies - §Y[amplifier_planet.GetName]§!. It might disrupt some of your systems, but I promise you - I will make it worth you a while the next time I make rounds across the galaxy."
 mem_surveyor.106.desc:0 "Greetings. Your assistance is urgently needed. \n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to use one of your science vessels and its crew to observe surface of §Y[scannable_planet.GetName]§!. Do it, and a fair compensation will be provided next time we meet."
 mem_surveyor.107.desc:0 "Exciting news! I have some data. \n\nI mean, I always have some data, but today I have the dataest of them all. And I want you to help me process it. How about it? \n\nAgree, and I can make it worth you a while next time we meet."
