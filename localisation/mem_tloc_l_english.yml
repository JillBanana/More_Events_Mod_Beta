 #PROJECT CHAIN
 mem_lotc_first_chain_title:0 "The Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc_first_chain_desc:0 "Long ago a species calling themselves Carcharorion had set up an operation to foribly move our ancestors elsewhere. Following the coordiates they left behind we might find more."
 mem_lotc_clues:0 "§GSites investigated"
 
 MEM_LOTC_FIRST:0 "Underwater facility"
 MEM_LOTC_FIRST_DESC:0 "Judging by the coordinates, some kind of installation is hidden beneath the ocean on a distant Planet."
 
 mem_lotc_poi.2:0 "Rendezvous point"
 mem_lotc_poi.2.desc:0 "The coordinates is some kind of rendezvous point for Carcharorion. If they are still around, they might be there."
 
 MEM_LOTC_THIRD:0 "The Hub"
 MEM_LOTC_THIRD_DESC:0 "The coordinates are presumed to be for some sort of commercial or rest & recreation hub operated by the Carcharorion."
 
 MEM_LOTC_FOURTH:0 "The Memorial"
 MEM_LOTC_FOURTH_DESC:0 "The final sets of coordinates should lead to an isolated complex that might be some kind of memorial or a museum."
 
 MEM_LOTC_BOARDING_CRUISER:0 "Boarding the cruiser"
 MEM_LOTC_BOARDING_CRUISER_DESC:0 "Now that the Carcharorion cruiser had been disabled, we can attempt to board it."
 
 #EVENTS
 
 mem_lotc.1.name:0 "Trafficking operation"
 mem_lotc.1.desc:0 "After exploring the complex extensively, our science team had made an amazing discovery. The data cores appears to be mostly wiped or eroded, but we established that complex belonged to a civilization unfamiliar to us, that went by name Carcharorion. Apparently, they operated several thousands of years ago in this sector of the galaxy. \n\nSomething else however is much more unusual. Lower level is densely packed with large number of stasis pods containing.., bodies of our own species. Many of them are still wearing advanced shackles or have crude implants inside their nervous system. It seems, those Carcharorion had abducted some of our primitive ancestors and subjected them to some kind of experiments, before for reason unknown they've chosen to simply kill them by cutting the power supply to stasis pods leaving inmates to suffocate. \n\nWe are picking elevated radiation level from the walls and equipment inside the complex. The power core seems to be either sabotaged and suffered a leak in the past, but now we can not be sure. Residue data extracted from the data cores also contained several sets of coordinates."
 mem_lotc.1a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 mem_lotc.2.name:0 "Underwater facility"
 mem_lotc.2.desc:0 "Submerged beneath the water, our science team had uncovered the ruins of some kind of habitat. Oddly, it appears to be wholesale produced from spaceship components. [Leader.GetName] estimates that several hundreds individuals lived here until it was hit by orbital bombardment. Most of the equipment had been damaged by salt water but our science team managed to recover a fragment of navigational data, that can be useful in proper context. Oddly, both the complex and projectiles recovered on site used the same design."
 mem_lotc.2a:0 "A civil war?"
 
 mem_lotc.3.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.3.desc:0 "We are detecting a lonely ship orbiting a gas giant. It seems badly weathered but is clearly still operational. We should approach with caution."
 
 mem_lotc.4.name:0 "The Hub"
 mem_lotc.4.desc:0 "Several Carcharorion vessels seems to be welded together and placed on stable orbit around [FromFrom.GetName]. As our science team made their way in, they found nothing but decay and abandonment. Most of the life support and other vital systems were dismantled, however the team had found an isolated holosuite they've managed to briefly power up with their ship's systems. In doing so, they found themselves on a surface of a strange world, staring at the unfamiliar sky. They managed to record stars in the sky before the suite burnt out permanently, which, if accurate, could allow us to narrow down location of the planet recreated."
 mem_lotc.4a:0 "Could it be their homeworld?"
 
 mem_lotc.5.name:0 "The Memorial"
 mem_lotc.5.desc:0 "Unfortunately, we were too late by a few centuries. The remains of the complex are still recognizable at the edges of an impact crater, but most of it was obliterated by a meteorite strike. What survived, however, was very interesting. A handful of large rock slabs were still covered of pictogram from which looks of Carcharorion can be identified. A surviving data core [Leader.GetName] had found also contains references to their home system. With additional data to fill the gap, it could lead us straight to it."
 mem_lotc.5a:0 "We'll look into it."
 
 mem_lotc.7.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.7.desc:0 "Now that the Carcharorion cruiser is disabled, we should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.7a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.8.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.8.desc:0 "Someone else had disabled the Carcharorion cruiser and left it to drift aimlessly. We should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.8a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.9.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.9.desc:0 "We are detecting a disabled Carcharorion ship drifting aimlessly. We should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.9a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.10.name:0 "Boarding successful"
 mem_lotc.10.desc:0 "As our forces boarded the ship, they were greeted with a gruesome sight. Bodies of multiple species, who by all means should be dead, stumbled around, attempting to defend the ship. Some of them were even our own species! \n\nIt appears, they are still propelled by extensive neural implanting, that kept them going even after death. Fighting all the way through, boarding party had made their way to the ship's bridge. Some data from flight computers was still usable, and among other things, it indicated that the ship's faster-than-light technology had experiencing major problems, the kind of which we had eliminated before we even left our home system. \n\nTampering with ship's systems appears to have triggered some kind of self-destruction sequence, causing ship to vaporise moments after our boarding crew returned."
 mem_lotc.10a:0 "Disturbing."
 
 mem_lotc.11.name:0 "The Carcharorion home system"
 mem_lotc.11.desc:0 "With data we collected, we can identify presumed home system the mysterious Carcharorion. We should explore it to find out what happened to them and what connection they had with our species."
 mem_lotc.11a:0 "Onward, to answers!"
