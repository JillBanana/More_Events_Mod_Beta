 mem_lost_emperor_category_desc:0 "Our sensors have caught glimpses of a small, metallic object orbiting the star at an unusually close distance. We should investigate this further."

 mem_lost_emperor.1.name:0 "Mysterious Vessel"
 mem_lost_emperor.1.desc:0 "It turns out the object is a metal capsule, possibly large enough to house a living being. It seems to be covered in solar panels of some advanced design. Energy readings show that it is consuming an extraordinary amount of power, presumably partly to keep it afloat in this orbit.\n\nEver since the [root.GetName] fixed its sensors on the slab and began to approach, it has been broadcasting a message to us. Sent in around six dozen languages, it reads: "Danger! Keep your distance!" Presumably it is sent by some sort of artificial intelligence."
 mem_lost_emperor.1.A:0 "Better leave it be."
 mem_lost_emperor.1.B:0 "This sounds interesting. Let's check it out."

 mem_lost_emperor.2.B:0 "Ignore the warning. It can't be that strong, can it?"

 mem_lost_emperor.3.name:0 "Ship Destroyed!"
 mem_lost_emperor.3.desc:0 "A powerful electric pulse has annihilated the [root.GetName], killing all on board."

 mem_lost_emperor.4.desc:0 "I am Azran, the entity in charge of this vessel. I have been charged with the protection of my cargo and the protection of the galaxy from it.

 mem_lost_emperor.4.D.dialogue:0 "Is there any information that is not classified?"

 mem_lost_emperor.4.E.dialogue:0 "Is there anyone else we can speak with?"
 mem_lost_emperor.4.E.response:0 "This is your final warning. Desist or I will shoot."

 mem_lost_emperor.5.name:0 "The Vessel Activates"
 mem_lost_emperor.5.desc:0 "Our ships approach the capsule. Once again, "Azran" is sending us warnings that we must desist from approaching. Suddenly it kicks into life, attacking our ships with a surprisingly strong barrage of energy pulses."
 mem_lost_emperor.5.desc.again:0 "As our vessels near the capsule, Azran powers up to do battle with our fleet again. May this attempt be more fortunate than the last!"

 mem_lost_emperor_military_investigate_1_DESC:0 "A mysterious vessel known as "Azran" appears to be guarding an important secret.

 mem_lost_emperor.6.name:0 "Defeat!"
 mem_lost_emperor.6.desc:0 ""Azran" has proven too powerful for our fleet! Our ships have been forced to flee in disarray."
