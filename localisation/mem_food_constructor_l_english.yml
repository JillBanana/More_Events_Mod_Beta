 mem_food_constructor_chain_title:0 "Food constructor"
 mem_food_constructor_chain_desc:0 "Strange alien device in our posession is churning out food dust at ever increasing quantities with no end in sight. We need to find a way to stop it before it's too late"
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_1:0 "Food dust"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_1_desc:0 "The planet houses an alien machine that constantly produces nutritious dust for locals to consume."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_2:0 "Food dust overflow"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_2_desc:0 "The planet is dangerously close to being buried under food constructor's produce. Thin grey dust is flooding the areas surrounding it while winds create unprecedentedly nutritious dust storms."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_3:0 "Food dust everywhere"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_3_desc:0 "Thin food dust has covered the entire planetary surface, while constructor is draining the energy grid to increase its output with every moment. Edible as it is, the blessing is now turned into a terrible curse for local population."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_4:0 "Rising food tide"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_4_desc:0 "Nutritious dust from the food constructor is covering the entire planetary surface with a layer of at least a kilometre thick. Locals might never have to go hungry again, but they can hardly go anywhere at all."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_5:0 "The dust had settled"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_5_desc:0 "With the food constructor shut down for good, life on the planet is returning back to normal. The layer of decomposing dust have proven to be a very good fertilizer, and the planetary ecosystem flourishes."

 mem_food_constructor.1.name:0 "A curious discovery"
 mem_food_constructor.1.desc:0 "One of the colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has made a curious discovery where he stumbled upon a massive alien artefact while exploring outskirts of the settlement. After accidentally activating it, he noticed it producing fine grey dust. Later analysis revealed that this dust is harmless and, in fact, makes very nutritious food fit for consumption by almost any organism. This promises major benefits for local population and [Owner.GetName] as a whole."
 mem_food_constructor.1a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_food_constructor.1b:0 "This a gift from alien intelligence."
 mem_food_constructor.1c:0 "Carefully, it might be booby-trapped."
 mem_food_constructor.1d:0 "Truly a divine blessing."
 mem_food_constructor.1e:0 "We should not trust alien technology."
 
 mem_food_constructor.2.name:0 "Production outstrips consumption"
 mem_food_constructor.2.desc:0 "Alarming reports from §Y[Root.GetName]§! where ever growing output of food constructor had reached the level where people can no longer eat it or ship off-world fast enough. Attempts to shut the device down had proven futile - decoded inscriptions on the construct mention §Y"Reesan key"§! as a mean to deactivate it - however we possess no such thing. Attempts to destroy the machine has also proven futile - its hull seems tougher than any artificial material we know of. Landfills are threatening to overflow and people flee districts surrounding the building where machine is housed."
 mem_food_constructor.2a:0 "We need to find a way to shut it down!"
 mem_food_constructor.2b:0 "What happened to good old "Off" button?"
 mem_food_constructor.2c:0 "We should not have trusted alien technology."
 
 mem_food_constructor.3.name:0 "Planet is drowning in food"
 mem_food_constructor.3.desc:0 "Local authorities on [Root.GetName] have officially given up on attempts to contain the situation. Ever-growing output of food constructor has overwhelmed any attempts to dispose of it in landfills or carry it off-world. The entire planet is grey with thick layer of food dust. What's worse is that constructor appears to draw energy from the local grid, hampering its performance."
 mem_food_constructor.3a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 mem_food_constructor.3b:0 "What have science done!"
 mem_food_constructor.3c:0 "We should §RNOT§! have trusted alien technology!"
 mem_food_constructor.3d:0 "Looks like it didn't even have to be booby-trapped."
 mem_food_constructor.3e:0 "A tragic oversight on creators' part, for sure"
 
 mem_food_constructor.4.name:0 "Food tide"
 mem_food_constructor.4.desc:0 "Life on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has turned into a constant race against the rising food tide, forcing population to constantly move to new heights to escape ever growing produce of the food constructor. Most of the industry had chocked on the fine grey dust covering the planet."
 mem_food_constructor.4a:0 "Please make it stop!"
