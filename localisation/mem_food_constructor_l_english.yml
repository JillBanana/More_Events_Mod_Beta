 mem_food_constructor_chain_title:0 "Food constructor"
 mem_food_constructor_chain_desc:0 "Strange alien device in our posession is churning out food dust at ever increasing quantities with no end in sight. We need to find a way to stop it before it's too late"
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_1:0 "Food dust"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_1_desc:0 "The planet houses an alien machine that constantly produces nutritious dust for locals to consume."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_2:0 "Food dust overflow"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_2_desc:0 "The planet is dangerously close to being buried under food constructor's produce. Thin grey dust is flooding the areas surrounding it while winds create unprecedentedly nutritious dust storms."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_3:0 "Food dust everywhere"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_3_desc:0 "Thin food dust has covered the entire planetary surface, while constructor is draining the energy grid to increase its output with every moment. Edible as it is, the blessing is now turned into a terrible curse for local population."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_4:0 "Rising food tide"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_4_desc:0 "Nutritious dust from the food constructor is covering the entire planetary surface with a layer of at least a kilometre thick. Locals might never have to go hungry again, but they can hardly go anywhere at all."
 
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_5:0 "The dust had settled"
 mem_food_constructor_modifier_5_desc:0 "With the food constructor shut down for good, life on the planet is returning back to normal. The layer of decomposing dust have proven to be a very good fertilizer, and the planetary ecosystem flourishes."

 mem_food_constructor.1.name:0 "A curious discovery"
 mem_food_constructor.1.desc:0 "One of the colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has made a curious discovery where he stumbled upon a massive alien artefact while exploring outskirts of the settlement. After accidentally activating it, he noticed it producing fine grey dust. Later analysis revealed that this dust is harmless and, in fact, makes very nutritious food fit for consumption by almost any organism. This promises major benefits for local population and [Owner.GetName] as a whole."
 mem_food_constructor.1a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_food_constructor.1b:0 "This a gift from alien intelligence."
 mem_food_constructor.1c:0 "Carefully, it might be booby-trapped."
 mem_food_constructor.1d:0 "Truly a divine blessing."
 mem_food_constructor.1e:0 "We should not trust alien technology."
 
 mem_food_constructor.2.name:0 "Production outstrips consumption"
 mem_food_constructor.2.desc:0 "Alarming reports from §Y[Root.GetName]§! where ever growing output of food constructor had reached the level where people can no longer eat it or ship off-world fast enough. Attempts to shut the device down had proven futile - decoded inscriptions on the construct mention §Y"Reesan key"§! as a mean to deactivate it - however we possess no such thing. Attempts to destroy the machine has also proven futile - its hull seems tougher than any artificial material we know of. Landfills are threatening to overflow and people flee districts surrounding the building where machine is housed."
 mem_food_constructor.2a:0 "We need to find a way to shut it down!"
 mem_food_constructor.2b:0 "What happened to good old "Off" button?"
 mem_food_constructor.2c:0 "We should not have trusted alien technology."
 
 mem_food_constructor.3.name:0 "Planet is drowning in food"
 mem_food_constructor.3.desc:0 "Local authorities on [Root.GetName] have officially given up on attempts to contain the situation. Ever-growing output of food constructor has overwhelmed any attempts to dispose of it in landfills or carry it off-world. The entire planet is grey with thick layer of food dust. What's worse is that constructor appears to draw energy from the local grid, hampering its performance."
 mem_food_constructor.3a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 mem_food_constructor.3b:0 "What have science done!"
 mem_food_constructor.3c:0 "We should §RNOT§! have trusted alien technology!"
 mem_food_constructor.3d:0 "Looks like it didn't even have to be booby-trapped."
 mem_food_constructor.3e:0 "A tragic oversight on creators' part, for sure"
 
 mem_food_constructor.4.name:0 "Food tide"
 mem_food_constructor.4.desc:0 "Life on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has turned into a constant race against the rising food tide, forcing population to constantly move to new heights to escape ever growing produce of the food constructor. Most of the industry had chocked on the fine grey dust covering the planet."
 mem_food_constructor.4a:0 "Please make it stop!"
 
 mem_food_constructor.5.name:0 "Possible Reesan key lead"
 mem_food_constructor.5.desc:0 "Our long-range sensors have picked up a faint energy signal resembling energy signature of a working food constructor similar to one in our possession. Although it reached us outside of FTL and whoever operated it are likely long gone, they might have left behind a clue to locate the elusive §YReesan key§!."
 mem_food_constructor.5a:0 "We need to investigate as soon as possible!"
 
 mem_food_constructor_poi1:0 "Food constructor's signature"
 mem_food_constructor_poi1_desc:0 "Energy signature we picked up recently originates from this system. Perhaps we could find the creators of the food constructor. Or at least a clue..."
  
 mem_food_constructor.6.name:0 "We are at the site"
 mem_food_constructor.6.desc:0 "Energy trail had lead to star system §Y[From.GetName]§!. Very faint energy signatures of a working food constructor seem to be concentrated around one of system's planets."
 mem_food_constructor.6a:0 "We better check it out."
 
 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CRASHSITE:0 "Planetary investigation"
 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CRASHSITE_DESC:0 "Faint energy signature suggests that a food constructor was once operational nearby. We might find vital clues about how to turn it off"
 
 mem_food_constructor.7.name:0 "We are getting closer"
 mem_food_constructor.7.desc:0 "Following ancient energy trail we have eventually found a massive cargo ship crashed on a desolate world. It appears its crew tried to tow a constructor, still welded to the ship's hull into a star, only have their systems drained of energy mid-flight by the constructor. Dead ship have drifted aimlessly for some time until it was caught into planet's gravity and eventually crashed on its surface.\n\nWhat little data we could pull from the dead flight computers revealed that original mission was to deliver the constructor to an asteroid base, in hope that a reclusive alien researcher who owns it would be able to deactivate the constructor. We have copied the coordinates of the base."
 mem_food_constructor.7a:0 "We might still have a chance."
 
 mem_food_constructor_poi2:0 "Reclusive scientist"
 mem_food_constructor_poi2_desc:0 "A ship we found was on its way to see a reclusive scientist. We should pay him a visit."
 
 mem_food_constructor.8.name:0 "Solitude system"
 mem_food_constructor.8.desc:0 "We have arrived to the set of coordinates where scientist studying food constructors was once operating. If the flight path was correct, his base was within the large asteroid."
 mem_food_constructor.8a:0 "We should pay him a visit."
 
 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_RECLUSE:0 "Asteroid base investigation"
 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_RECLUSE_DESC:0 "A scientist studying food constructors was once operating from an asteroid base. We should see if he left any clues behind"
 
 mem_food_constructor.9.name:0 "Asteroid base"
 mem_food_constructor.9.desc:0 "Our scientists have successfully located an asteroid that was hollowed to house some sort of research station and habitat. Just like the ship before it, its systems are drained of energy while its interior is filled with long-expired food dust. Using miniature drills our science team have successfully dug into the core of the facility and managed to locate former owner of the station, his remains well-preserved in the dust. They managed to extract some data from his digital assistant. It appears he was experimenting on one of the food constructors in attempt to find a way to shut it down, when sudden spike of production has breached the containment and suffocated him. Although he was not able to turn the constructor off, he appears to have deduced the location where designers of the constructor operated."
 mem_food_constructor.9a:0 "The Reesan Key is almost within our grasp!"
 
 mem_food_constructor_poi3:0 "Reesan operations"
 mem_food_constructor_poi3_desc:0 "Elusive Reesans were once operating from this system. They might still be there."
 
 mem_food_constructor.10.name:0 "Reesan operations"
 mem_food_constructor.10.desc:0 "We have arrived to a system identified by a dead researcher. Massive ring world is spanning the system. Massive and badly damaged. Powerful technology definitely flourished here once, but this place clearly saw better days. Among the badly damaged ring world, one section is still standing and if we are find §YReesan Key§! anywhere, it's there. \n\nHowever, not everything is cold and dead. We are detecting a fleet of powerful automatic ships in the system. They are hailing us."
 
 mem_food_constructor.11.desc:0 "We have arrived to a system identified by a dead researcher. Massive ring world is spanning the system. Massive and badly damaged.

 mem_food_constructor.12a:0 "How long until your manage arrives?"
 mem_food_constructor.12a.response:0 "Our services were suspended for §RINTEGER OVERFLOW§! years as of the moment, which is slightly longer than usual. I apologize for that. But I assure you, manager will arrive shortly. In a mean time, please tell me if I can make your wait more comfortable. \n\nWhen such situation arises, we usually offer our clients special cookies made with special recipe. Unfortunately, right now we can only offer you §RPETRIFIED DUST§!. Would you like some?"
 
 mem_food_constructor.12b:0 "Why were your operations suspended?"
 mem_food_constructor.12b.response:0 "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can not disclose this information. Try asking one of our managers, when they arrive."

 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_REESAN:0 "Investigate Reesan Operation"
 MEM_FOOD_CONSTRUCTOR_REESAN_DESC:0 "Among the ruins of a massive ring world one segment is still standing. Perhaps if we rummage through it, we would find a Reesan Key."
 
 mem_food_constructor.13.name:0 "Reesan Key located!"
 mem_food_constructor.13.desc:0 "Our science team has searched countless warehouses on the ring world. Among many devices way beyond our understanding we have located a gigantic warehouse filled with what without a doubt are Reesan keys. Science team reports there were no complications with recovering one. The rest of bizzare Reesan contraptions will provide invaluable insight for years to come."
 mem_food_constructor.13a.tooltip:0 "Reesan key will be delivered as soon as possible"
 mem_food_constructor.13b:0 "Now we could easily shut down food constructor. If we had one."
 mem_food_constructor.13b.tooltip:0 "Reesan key will be in our posession in case we ever need it"
 
 mem_food_constructor.14.name:0 "Food constructor shutdown"
 mem_food_constructor.14.desc:0 "Citizens of §Y[Root.GetName]§! celebrate as Reesan Key is delivered to them and inserted into the food constructor. The grey nutritious nightmare is finally over as the device appears to have been drained of all energy."
 mem_food_constructor.14a:0 "It's finally over!"
 
 mem_food_constructor.15.name:0 "Ecosystem transformation"
 mem_food_constructor.15.desc:0 "Amazing news from the §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The thick layer of food dust that was covering the planet has effected dramatic change on planet's ecosystem. With influx of easy and abundant energy, life on planet flourished and biodiversity skyrocketed! This dramatic change lead to the planet's official reclassification into a gaia world."
 mem_food_constructor.15b:0 "Spirits work in mysterious ways..."
 mem_food_constructor.15c:0 "We should be forever grateful to the enigmatic Reesans."
