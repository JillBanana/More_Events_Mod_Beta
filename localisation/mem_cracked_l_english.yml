 mem_cracked.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that deep penetration scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have detected an unusual object beneath its surface - right where fault lines were presumed to originate. \n\nThe only plausbile explaination is that a ship or a group of ships of some sort had somehow teleported inside the asteroid and merged with it.
