 mem_cracked_category:0 "Cracked"
 mem_cracked_category_desc:0 "A web of fault lines covers this asteroid, but they do not originate from an external impact - it's as if it was cracked from the inside. Our instruments have detected a faint energy signature emanating from the asteroid."
 
 mem_cracked.1.name:0 "Point of Entry"
 
 MEM_CRACKED_CUT_OUT:0 "Extraction"
 MEM_CRACKED_CUT_OUT_DESC:0 "Whatever's trapped inside the asteroid, we require precision mining equipment to bring it out safely. A construction ship can do the job."
 
 mem_cracked.2.name:0 "Warship from Beyond"
 mem_cracked.2.desc:0 "~~chief scientist name~~ was right - a ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Even more curiously, the warship is a heretofore unseen design and makeup. Our findings suggest that this ship originated from outside of our current dimension, raising a great many questions from ~~species~~'s scientific community. Still, with the crew unaccounted for and the warship in good condition, we've brought in our own and commissioned the ship into our fleet."
 
 mem_cracked.3.name:0 "Science Vessel from Beyond"
 mem_cracked.3.desc:0 "~~chief scientist name~~ was right - a ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Even more curiously, this science vessel is a heretofore unseen design and makeup. Our findings suggest that this ship originated from outside of our current dimension, raising a great many questions from ~~species~~'s scientific community. Still, with the crew unaccounted for and the science ship containing advanced equipment, we've crewed the vessel with our own."
 
 mem_cracked.4.name:0 "Destruction"
 mem_cracked.4.desc:0 "The extraction crew misread a survey of the asteroid's internal activity and triggered its total destruction through ill-advised drilling. Still, ~~chief scientist name~~ was right - a ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Examining its debris will provide some fascinating scientific data on this bizarre ship that shows no relation to any vessel or materials we've yet discovered."
 
 mem_cracked.5.name:0 "Jack-In-The-Rock"
 mem_cracked.5.desc:0 "~~chief scientist name~~ was right - except that not one ship was trapped inside the asteroid, it was two. As we finished freeing them from the rock, both ships immediately powered up and directed their weapon systems toward us."
 
 ~~launch an event after blowing them up?~~
 
 mem_cracked.10.name:0 "A Crack in Space"
 mem_cracked.10.desc:0 "~~chief scientist name~~ was right - a ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. However, just as our drills prepared to free it, it vanished in a cacophony of energy that shattered the asteroid and disrupted our ships' shields. After recovering from the incident, our crews reported that their hulls were strangely altered by the bizarre traveler. Whatever their origins, their technology has inspired debate over hyperdrives capable of tearing through the fabric of space."
 
 mem_cracked.9999.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_cracked.9990.desc:0 "Anomaly Failed in a way that won't matter in 2.1! ~~or, you know, actually writing something~~ Despite our best efforts, the asteroid ripped itself apart from some unseen force. Strangely, nothing of note was found in the debris, and the bizarre readings we picked up are entirely gone."
