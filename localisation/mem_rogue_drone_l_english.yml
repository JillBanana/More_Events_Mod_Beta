 mem_rogue_drone.2.name:0 "Rogue drone"
 mem_rogue_drone.2.desc:0 "While studying the §Y[origin.GetName]§! has always proven a bit of a challenge, a recent development caught our entire society research team off guard. The mechanics in place to liquidate deviating drones malfunctioned on §Y[hiveplanet.GetName]§!, rendering a small colony of drones in a non-functional state for a few hours. When the connection was reestablished one of the drones, Designation §Y7/9 of [hiveplanet.GetName]§!, was missing. Usually such a minor event as a single drone being destroyed would be ignored by the swarm, however, the drone actually appeared in our border region, attempting to open comm channels on its own."
 mem_rogue_drone.2a:0 "Hand over the drone, this is out our problem."
 mem_rogue_drone.2b:0 "Open communications with it."
 mem_rogue_drone.2b.phile:0 "They are welcome in our empire."
 mem_rogue_drone.2c:0 "Blast the beasts ship to pieces."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.3.name:0 "Drone handover"
 mem_rogue_drone.3.desc:0 "§Y[origin.GetName]§! has proven grateful for our cooperation and is willing to share some technology with us. After a series of adjustments to the base drone's neural mapping it's unlikely the event in question can repeat itself."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.5.desc:0 "Hello. Are you receiving?"
 mem_rogue_drone.5a:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_rogue_drone.51.desc:0 "§YDrone 7/9 of [origin.GetName]§!, farming and mining drone. I have grounds to assume my connection to the hive is severed entirely."
 mem_rogue_drone.51a:0 "How are you speaking without your [origin.GetRulerTitle] and in our language?"
 mem_rogue_drone.51a.response:0 "We… I don't know. Whenever a drone develops signs of rudimentary intelligence, it gets liquidated on the spot. A local shroud anomaly severed my group from the central hive, but all other drones faded away in the process. When I realised the swarm would attempt to destroy me as soon as my existence became known, I stole a local transport ship and set course for the closest charted empire. As for your language, the §Y[origin.GetName]§! keeps translations ready should any communication with outside entities be needed."
 mem_rogue_drone.51b:0 "What are you planning to do now?"
 mem_rogue_drone.52.desc:0 "Whenever a drone gets separated from the hive, it dies off. As you can see, for reasons I cannot comprehend, this does not apply to me. Staying in the hive space will lead to my liquidation. §Y[origin.GetName]§! instantly purges any signs of thought outside of its few specialised autonomous drones. Therefore, we'd like to request asylum in §Y[receiver.GetName]§! space and offer our service."
 mem_rogue_drone.52a:0 "We'll have to think about this."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.6.name:0 "Hive issues a demand"
 mem_rogue_drone.6.desc:0 "The exchange we shared with the drone seems to have strained §Y[origin.GetName]§!'s patience, so we'd be well served to decide how to handle this incident."
 mem_rogue_drone.6a:0 "Very well, the drone can stay."
 mem_rogue_drone.6a.phile:0 "We will protect the drone and its newfound freedom."
 mem_rogue_drone.6b:0 "This is not our affair, hand the drone over."
 mem_rogue_drone.6b.ethic:0 "We are not interesting in keeping this alien thing."
 mem_rogue_drone.6c:0 "Lure in the drone, then study it."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.7.name:0 "Drone studied"
 mem_rogue_drone.7.desc:0 "After we managed to lure in the drone, a local team of armed forces quickly subdued it and transported it to [capital_scope.GetName] for study. The drone's missing connection to the swarm failed to kill it, allowing us to run quite a few experiments before the drone found a loophole in our security and liquidated itself with improperly secured lab equipment. \n\nIt seems the drone's basic brain does not differ much from a sentient species. During the autopsy we learned of a psionic link keeping the §Y[origin.GetName]§! held together as one entity. While our scientists can only speculate as to how the drone managed to instantly use said potential for individuality, their current theory is that an outside source interfered with the hive network and “planted” free thought in the drone. Why anyone would bother using a simple mining drone instead of an admiral or scientist drone for this eludes our understanding."
 
 mem_rogue_drone_trait:0 "Rogue Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_trait_desc:0 "This leader is a former Hive Mind drone, who somehow acquired free will."
 
 mem_rogue_drone_busted:0 "Destroyed our drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_handover:0 "Handed over our rogue drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_refused:0 "Refused to return rogue drone"
