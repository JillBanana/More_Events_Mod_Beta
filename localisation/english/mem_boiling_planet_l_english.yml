 mem_boiling.1.desc:0 "As deep probing shown, [From.From.GetName] is not as "frozen" as we assumed. It's rocky part is actually quite tiny with most of its mass being water, with highly active overheated core surrounded by extremely thin crust. This creates an extremely potent geothermal heater that boils water at the bottom, only to see it cool as it rises to the surface and freezes into solid kilometres-thick ice covering."
