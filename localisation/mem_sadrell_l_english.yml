mem_sadrell.2.name: "The Orphan Gate"
mem_sadrell.2.desc: "We have enountered an unusual §Sgateway§! in §Y[From.GetName]§! System. \n\nIt bears strong marks of tampering and deliberate alterations, that seem to have permanently disabled its ability to connect with other parts of gateway network. Theoretically, it would be able to connect to one specific gate, however all data related to such a connection had been wiped from the gate's control system. \n\nIf it can be opened, it must be done from the other side."
