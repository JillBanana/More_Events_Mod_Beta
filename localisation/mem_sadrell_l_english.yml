# Events
mem_sadrell.2.name: "The Orphan Gate"
mem_sadrell.2.desc: "We have enountered an unusual §Sgateway§! in §Y[From.GetName]§! System. \n\nIt bears strong marks of tampering and deliberate alterations, that seem to have permanently disabled its ability to connect with other parts of gateway network. Theoretically, it would be able to connect to one specific gate, however all data related to such a connection had been wiped from the gate's control system. \n\nIf it can be opened, it must be done from the other side."


 mem_sadrell.101.name: "The Orphan Gate"
 mem_sadrell.101.desc: "We are observing strange activity within §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! System. \n\nPreviously inert gateway stationed there is starting to show signs of activity. Even though it has not yet established a stable connection, we are receiving a signal from the other side. It seems it was meant specifically for us."

 mem_sadrell.104.desc: "Our remote tracking systems detected unusual activity within §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! System. \n\nPreviously inert gateway stationed there had been re-activated, opening pathway to previously inaccessible star cluster outside of main galaxy's space. Said cluster appears to have hosted an advanced civilisation that is now claiming several unowned star systems in the vicinity. They are hailing us."
 mem_sadrell.110.desc: "Hello. Are you receiving? Good. \n\nI am speaking on behalf of the [newcomer_country.GetName] the last survivors of once proud Sadrell species. \n\nOur civilisation had been struggling ever since we were forced to fleet the galaxy through what you call "§SOrphan Gate§!". In our current state, we can no longer maintain our isolation and will have to take the risk and return to the galaxy our ancestors abandoned 600 years ago. We have exhausted all our options, colonizing hostile environment and settling void habitats; §Swe have augmented ourselves with cybernetics just to survive the harsh conditions§!. \n\nWhat you need to know is that we consider every system within §S2§! hyperlane jumps from §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! as our essential core territory. That includes some systems you claimed for yourself. \n\nWe humbly request that you return our ancestral lands, in the name of lasting galactic peace."
 mem_sadrell.110.a: "Very well. We will cede our territory."
 mem_sadrell.110.b: "No way. You get nothing from us."
 mem_sadrell.110.c: "We could share our land... with a loyal vassal."
 mem_sadrell.110.d: "We can share this territory as members of a federation."
 mem_sadrell.110.e: "Perhaps you could join our federation in exchange?"
 mem_sadrell.110.f: "Why did you abandon the galaxy?"
 mem_sadrell.110.f.response: "We were once part of the great §YUnited Sadrell Republic§!. Centuries ago we were a major player on galactic arena. Dozens of planets, and miriad of species working together for the greater future. It seemed that nothing could end our golden age. \n\nExcept it could. Prosperity brought complacency, complacency brought rigidity and stagnation. One major economic recession came after another until entire worlds found themselves on the brink of famine and civil war. Central government could not address the situation and did not seem to try that much either. \n\nEventually order broke down. Old rivalries rekindled. Skirmishes and pirate raids turned into a full-blown ever-escalating war. When the conflict approached the core world, some thought the Republic to be beyond saving. The recently activated gateway offered a sanctuary for large number of refugees, who sealed gates behind themselves in order to shut off the crisis permanently. \n\nSome might call them cowards, say that they should've stayed and fought for their home. But we are alive, and others are not. That's all the evidence needed."
 mem_sadrell.110.g: "Did you modify the gateway?"
 mem_sadrell.110.g.response: "No. We found it like this. \n\nIt seemed to be an experiment of a sort, to branch out from mainstream hyperlane network. Maybe whoever did this sought sanctuary; maybe they sought new resources. Maybe they just wanted to do it because they could. \n\nOur ancestors were only just figured out how the gateways worked when the crisis came. It seems that nobody have ever made it here before us either in thousands of years."
 mem_sadrell.110.purifier: "You should've kept those gates shut, Xeno."
 mem_sadrell.110.swarm: "We sense prey..."
 mem_sadrell.110.terminator: "You should've kept those gates shut, fleshlings."
 mem_sadrell.111.desc: "Good to hear. We would not want to start our new chapter in the galaxy with a new bloody war. \n\nDo not worry, we will take care of your worlds and hopefully, remain good friends with you."
 mem_sadrell.111.a: "Let there be peace in our time."
 mem_sadrell.111.b: "We will take them back eventually."
 mem_sadrell.111.b.tooltip: "Gain §SClaims§! on the systems ceded."
 mem_sadrell.112.desc: "I see. This is... unfortunate. \n\nWe knew the risks when we opened the gates. Even though we hoped for a peaceful solution, we are prepared to fight you to the bitter end. \n\nIf we are to have a future in this wretched galaxy, we must reclaim our home systems."
 mem_sadrell.112.desc.failed_vassalisation: "I'm afraid this is not an acceptable solution. \n\nWe knew the risks when we opened the gates. Even though we hoped for a peaceful solution, we are prepared to fight you to the bitter end. \n\nIf we are to have a future in this wretched galaxy, we must reclaim our home systems."
 mem_sadrell.112.a: "We are ready for you as well."
 mem_sadrell.112.mil: "Come and take them!"
 mem_sadrell.112.pac: "How horrible."
 mem_sadrell.114.desc: "I see. \n\nIt seems that we don't have much choice. \n\nTo go to war with you would be a grave mistake, and we don't have a future in this galaxy if we can't even return to our homes... We accept your terms."
 mem_sadrell.115.desc: "In the golden age of United Sadrell Republic, a galactic federation was a dream worth pursuing. \n\nIt is a small step, but a great symbol of returning of our past glory. We accept your offer."
 mem_sadrell.115.desc.breakdown: "You really would abandon your allies for us? This is very generous of you. \n\n$mem_sadrell.115.desc$"
 mem_sadrell.116.desc: "I see. The attitudes like this is why we sealed ourselves from the galaxy to begin with. \n\nA shame. Looks like the galaxy has not changed in our absence. But it is too late to turn back. We will fight for our future."
 mem_sadrell.116.purifier: "And you will die for our."
 mem_sadrell.116.teminator: "You will be destroyed."
 mem_sadrell.116.swarm: "HAK! HAK! HAK!"
 mem_sadrell.120.desc: "This is an interesting proposition, I can't deny it. \n\nJoining in an existing federation would be tricky. I hope your allies would support your generocity."

 mem_sadrell.124.desc: "It seems like your proposition has failed. And that leaves us in a rather awkward situation... \n\nWe can't join [Root.GetAllianceName] so where do we get from here?"
 mem_sadrell.124.a: "We will start our own federation!"
 mem_sadrell.124.b: "We will cede the systems unconditionally."
 mem_sadrell.124.c: "In this case, you get nothing."
 
 mem_sadrell.130.desc: "We are the Sadrell. Centuries ago we were forced to withdraw from the galaxy. \n\nOur civilisation had been struggling ever since we found refuge on the other side of what you call "§SOrphan Gate§!".

We have exhausted all our options, colonizing hostile environment and settling void habitats; §Swe have augmented ourselves with cybernetics just to survive the harsh conditions§!. \n\nNow, we have no choice but to un-seal our cluster and return.
