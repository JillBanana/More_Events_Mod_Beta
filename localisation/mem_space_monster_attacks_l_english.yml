 #Crystal appears in player system
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.name:0 "Crystalline Entity Approaches"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.desc:0 "Our colony's long range sensors picked up an alarming signal approaching from out of deep space. A quickly sent probe revealed it to be a giant crystalline structure. A communication attempt through our vessel was followed by an intense energy spike and the loss of contact with the probe.\n\nWe have to assume the crystal is hostile. The fleet has been put to high alert"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.a:0 "Why is it here?"
 
 # crytals has bombarded the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.name:0 "Death from Above"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.desc:0 "The colonial defense force stood no chance against the crystal entity. Immediatly after the battle had been decided it started to shower [This.GetName] with small crystal shards fired at high velocity. First reports speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties.\n\nWhile these numbers still rise by the hour the crystal has left the planet's orbit flying back into the void."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
 # crystal has been destroyed before bombarding the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.name:0 "Danger Averted"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.desc:0 "Our fleet has been victorious. Only broken shards are left of the crystal entity. Why it came here and attacked might never be revealed but our colony is safe once again.\n\nA brief scan of the crystal's remains showed them to be composed of highly valuable minerals. Nearby freighters have already been ordered to gather them. While most of these shards will be scraped for ressources, the more interesting pieces will be kept for further study.\n\nSome of our scientists already fantasize about possible applications like selfrepairing hulls while others point our that there is much foundational research to be done first before we can even hope for a big breakthrough."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.a:0 "Good work."

 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.name:0 "Retribution"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.desc:0 "Our fleet has been victorious. Only broken shards are left of the crystal entity. Though we might never know where it came from and why atleast through its destruction the victims of its brutal attack have been avenged.\n\nA brief scan of the crystal's remains showed them to be composed of highly valuable minerals. Nearby freighters have already been ordered to gather them. While most of these shards will be scraped for ressources, the more interesting pieces will be kept for further study.\n\nSome of our scientists already fantasize about possible applications like selfrepairing hulls while others point our that there is much foundational research to be done first before we can even hope for a big breakthrough."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.a:0 "Good work."
 
 # Project finished
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.name:0 "Crystal Analysis"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.desc:0 "The recovered crystal shards show remarkable similarities to the smaller specimens we have encountered before. Yet there is a striking difference in its behaviour. Whille the beforementioned crystals act aggressively their actions have always been limited to their territory. Also its enormous size leads our scientists to the conclusion that it has to be a new though related species.\n\nThe material which makes up almost the entirety of its mass possesses astonishing selfrepairing abilities. A property that may be applied to our ship's armor plates given some more time and research. A new research option has been added to the project pool."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 # crystals grow everywhere, what now?
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.name:0 "Crystal Infestation"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.desc:0 "As the colonists on [Root.GetName] were still recovering from the devastating attack, worrying reports about crystaline fragments starting to grow on various locations around the settlements came in.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the spreading of these crystals is not limited to the vicinity of the colony. Instead they can be found in varying concentrations across the planet slowly extracting minerals from the soil during their growing process. It is hard to tell at this point to which degree this will affect the planet's ecosystem.\n\nThere are multiple possible courses of action to be taken. The colonists could either try to root out the crystal infestation, periodically harvest them or study their growth."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.a:0 "Let them harvest the crystals regularly."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.a.tooltip:0 "Periodical harvests of these crystals will increase these colony's mineral output by 50%, but our scientists are not yet sure about possible long-term effects on the planet's ecosystem."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.b:0 "Let them study the crystals."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.b.tooltip:0 "The study of these crystals will increase these colony's society research output by 50%,but our scientists are not yet sure about possible long-term effects on the planet's ecosystem."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c:0 "Let them root out the crystal infestation."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c.tooltip:0 "The colonists on [Root.GetName] will focus on removing every last crystal spawn. All minerals gained during this process will added to the empire storage at the end of this process. The productivity of this colony will be reduced by 50% as long as this is going on."
 
 # planet turns bleak
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.name:0 "Biosphere Changes"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.desc:0 "Despite the colonists' constant efforts to contain the crystal infestation the spreading has now reached a critical extend. The damage to the planet's ecosystem is now undeniable. Farming outputs are at record low and vegetation in general is in a state of steady decline as the crystals exhaust the soil.\n\nThough our scientists are confident to be able to prevent the planet from becoming completely lifeless they doubt that this process can be reversed without extensive terraforming."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.a:0 "Concerning."
 
 # crystals removed
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.name:0 "The Great Cleansing"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.desc:0 "Finally, the last remaining traces of the crystal infestation on [Root.GetName] have been removed. Colonial life is slowly returning to normal.\n\nThe processed crystals have been added to our imperial storage."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.a:0 "Good news."
 
 MEM_SPACE_MONSTER_ATTACKS_CRYSTAL_STUDY:0 "Crystalline Remains"
 MEM_SPACE_MONSTER_ATTACKS_CRYSTAL_STUDY_DESC:0 "An investigation of the remaining crystal shards could prove beneficial to our reseach efforts though it will require a not insignificant amount of ressources and personnel in advance as our research department will have to focus on this study."
