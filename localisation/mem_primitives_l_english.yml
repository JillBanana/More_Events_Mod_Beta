 mem_primitives.101.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: One Small Step"
 mem_primitives.101.desc:0 "Today our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has witnessed an important benchmark of primitive civilization's advancement. A manned craft launched from planet's surface had reached its natural satellite - §Y[the_moon.GetName]§! - with crew leaving the craft for a prolonged period of time and walking across its surface. Although at this stage of development we can't expect such ventures to become permanent, it's none the less a major acheivement for the [From.GetName]. \n\nCrew of the observation post had good sense to maneuver out of sight and avoided detection for now."
 mem_primitives.101a:0 "Congratulations."
 mem_primitives.101a.phobe:0 "Why can't they keep their filth to themselves."
 mem_primitives.101a.mat:0 "They are on the right path."
 mem_primitives.101a.matphile:0 "They grow so fast!"
 
 mem_primitives.301.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Global Conflict"
 mem_primitives.301.desc:0 "Today marks the new age of §Y[From.GetName]§!. After a prolonged period of tension, an otherwise a fairly minor diplomatic incident had sparked a massive conflict between multiple international blocks. Almost entire planet is now infulged in the conflict with death toll projected to outstrip any other incident they could've brought on themselves. \n\nIt remains to be seen who will come out of it triumphant, but without a doubt this ordeal will have a profound effect on planet's history."
 
 mem_primitives.303.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: The War is Over"
 mem_primitives.303.desc:0 "A bloody conflict that had raged for some time on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had finally come to an end. Peace treaty signed today had effected a massive change on political landscape with multiple nation rising to prominence or falling from grace overnight. \n\nBut is this the end? Marred with massive reparation payments, humiliation and territorial loss, losers without a doubt will plan their revenge as soon as they can muster strength."
 mem_primitives.303a:0 "An armistice for 20 years."
 
 mem_primitives.305.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: To End all Wars"
 mem_primitives.305.desc:0 "Conflict raging on among §Y[From.GetName]§! had been in stalemate for some time with all sides suffering catastrophic losses in both personnel and economy. \n\nToday, it seem to have finally come to an end with white peace signed between the belligerents. With traumatic memories of the war fresh in public mind, peoples of the planet had come to shun military agression and see mutual understanding, hoping to never experience horrors of war again."
 
 mem_primitives.307.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: New Global Conflict"
 mem_primitives.307.desc:0 "Today, fragile peace on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had been upset anew. The nation that suffered the most humiliating defeat in the previous conflict and hardship it brought, under control of a ultrantionalist government led by a charismatic leader, had been showing agression for some time now, but now other major nations had finally decided that appeasement must end. \n\nArmed with ferocious fanatism of its people and advanced military doctrines, those revanschists are a formidable power backed by a block of similarly resentful nations but only time will tell if they have what it takes to wage war on almost entire world and turn the history around."
 mem_primitives.307a:0 "We knew it would happen eventually."
 
 mem_primitives.309.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Second Peace"
 mem_primitives.309.desc:0 "The war that was raging on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had come to an end. It seems that the history of §Y[from.GetName]§! is prone to repetition with the same block that won the first global war, winning the second. \n\nWith agressors obliterated and their ideologies throughtly discredited, we can expect this to become one of major turning points of this civilization."
 
 mem_primitives.311.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: New World Order"
 mem_primitives.311.desc:0 "Against all odds, an agressive block that started the global conflict on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had emerged victorious. \n\nThey might not control the entire planet, but they have reclaimed their status and emerged as the dominant power. With their nationalist rethoric proved true and war crimes sweeped under a proverbial rug, we can expect a profound change in the course of §Y[from.GetName]§!."
 
 mem_primitives.401.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.401.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had come to notice a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! religious development. \n\nA formerly minority cult founded by a mystic who was executed for his seditious behavior had flourished into a major religion and spread far and wide. Popular among the poor and disenfranchised, it teaches forgiveness and tolerance as its core values and promising heavenly rewards in the afterlife to those who leads virtuos life. \n\nNow that it had reached prominence and became empowered, we can expect its values to shift towards more hegemonic attitutes, however."
 
 mem_primitives.403.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.403.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had come to notice a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! religious development. \n\nA religion founded by a tribal warlord mystic had been spread across the large regions through conqest and conversion. A warlike religion, it is tightly intervowen with the statescraft and extolls discipline and willingness to make sacrifices to ensure its spread across the globe, promising paradise to those fallen fighting in its name."
 
 mem_primitives.405.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.405.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had come to notice a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! religious development. \n\nA new religion had been gaining prominence across the planet, focusing on finding inner peace through introspection and asketism. Believing that all souls are bound to be endlessly reborn over and over again, it promises its followers a chance to break away from the endless cycle of re-incarnation and achieve ethernal bliss in nothingness."
 
 mem_primitives.407.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.407.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! had come to notice a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! religious development. \n\nA quasi-religious teaching, combining religious trappings with pseudo-scientific presentation is gaining popularity among its elites. It teaches that most of the problems that plague the society originates from alien activity in the planet's past, more specifically an alien ruler who commited mass-murder of his subjects on the planet's surface. \n\nAllegedly, ghosts of the dead aliens are now haunting [the_planet.GetName] causing mental anguish among the population." 
 mem_primitives.407a:0 "Preposterous. We did no such thing."
