 #ONE SMALL STEP

 mem_primitives.101.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：一小步"
 mem_primitives.101.desc:0 "今天我們位於§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!上空的觀測站有幸目到當地土著文明的一場大躍進。一艘載人的太空船從星球地面升空，飛往她的衛星§Y[the_moon.GetName]§!，隊員更離開了太空艙一段時間在衛星的表面行走。雖然以目前的技術，我們不會預期[From.GetName]之後會經驗進行這類探索活動，不過今次依然是他們的最大成就。\n\n觀測站人員為了避免跟他們碰撞及被發現而讓路。"
 mem_primitives.101a:0 "恭喜他們。"
 mem_primitives.101a.phobe:0 "為什麼他們總要煩擾其他人？"
 mem_primitives.101a.mat:0 "他們走上正確的道路。"
 mem_primitives.101a.matphile:0 "他們長得真快！"
 
 #WORLD WARS
 
 mem_primitives.301.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：全球衝突"
 mem_primitives.301.desc:0 "今天§Y[From.GetName]§!展開新的一頁。經過了漫長的對峙後，一件看似無關痛癢的外交事件卻激起千重浪，引致幾個大國造成連串大型衝突。差不多整個星球都被拖進今次的衝突，死亡人數達到前所未有之高。\n\n現時仍未知鹿死誰手，不過今次必定對他們的歷史影響深遠。"
 
 mem_primitives.303.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：戰爭結束"
 mem_primitives.303.desc:0 "在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!上所發生的一場持續了一段時間的血腥衝突終於完結了。今日所簽定的和約導致整個政局起了重大變化，成王敗寇是唯一的結局。\n\n不過是否代表一個終結？敗者雖然要承受戰爭賠償、屈辱及割地，他們無庸置疑會韜光養晦後捲土重來。"
 mem_primitives.303a:0 "二十年的休戰。"
 
 mem_primitives.305.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：終結一切戰爭"
 mem_primitives.305.desc:0 "在§Y[From.GetName]§!上的衝突陷入了僵局，雙方的經濟及人力都受到災難性打擊。\n\n今天，交戰雙方為停戰達成協議，代表著戰爭終於完結。人們對戰爭帶來的痛苦歷歷在目，他們都對軍事擴張敬而遠之，希望重新建立互信及不再受戰爭洗禮。"
 mem_primitives.305a.milphobe:0 "可恥之舉。"
 mem_primitives.305a.pacphile:0 "他們終於找到光明。"
 
 mem_primitives.307.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：新的全球衝突"
 mem_primitives.307.desc:0 "今天，§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!脆弱的和平再次被打破。在上一次戰爭中被恥辱地擊潰的國家，最近被一個充滿極端民族主義味道的政府及其富魅力的領導者所控制，於近期不斷展示擴張的野心，不過其他大國都一致認為不能再姑息養奸。\n\n仗著他們人民的激進狂熱及先進的武器，矢意要雪恥的一群人背後有不少同樣感到受屈辱的國家所支持。只有時間才能證明他們有沒有真材實料，在整個星球上打這場仗及將歷史徹底改賓。"
 mem_primitives.307a:0 "我們早知道這早晚會發生。"
 
 mem_primitives.309.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：第二次和約"
 mem_primitives.309.desc:0 "在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!上爆發的戰爭又再一次完結。看起來§Y[from.GetName]§!的歷史注定要重現，因為上一次戰勝的一方又再次成為贏家\n\n發起戰爭的一方及其主義被完全抹去，我們可以預期這會成為文明的一大轉捩點。"
 
 mem_primitives.311.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：新世界秩序"
 mem_primitives.311.desc:0 "發起戰爭的一方在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!排除萬難地成為贏家。\n\n他們雖然未必可以完全控制整個星球，不過他們已經奪回地位並以王者姿態重生。在巧言令色的民族主義成為主流，及以前所犯下的戰爭罪行被抹得一乾二淨下，我們可以預期§Y[from.GetName]§!將會有影響深遠的轉變。"
 
 #RELIGIONS
 
 mem_primitives.401.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]：宗教發展"
 mem_primitives.401.desc:0 "我們位於§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!上空的觀測站留意到§Y[from.GetName]§!重大的轉變。\n\n一個因為煽動叛亂而已被處死的神秘人，他所成立的教派最近變得愈來愈活躍，並且在大眾之間流行起來，特別受到窮人及被剝奪的人歡迎。這個教派的宗旨是寬恕及包容，信徒認為在生前多做善事，在往生後就會獲得更豐厚的回報。\n\n現在這個教派漸漸掌權，我們預期它的價值觀將會轉為更具支配性。"
 mem_primitives.401a.mat:0 "我們是否曾經那麼愚蠢？"
 mem_primitives.401a.sp:0 "讓我們看看他們會否走上正確道路。"
 mem_primitives.401a.sphile:0 "他們要靠自己找到真理。"
 mem_primitives.401a.sphobe:0 "我們早晚要解決這爛攤子。"
 
 mem_primitives.403.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.403.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA religion founded by a tribal warlord mystic had been spread across the large regions through conquest and conversion. A warlike faith, it is tightly intervowen with statecraft and extols discipline and the willingness to make sacrifices to ensure its spread across the globe, promising paradise to those who fall fighting in its name."
 
 mem_primitives.405.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.405.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA new religion had been gaining prominence across the planet, focusing on finding inner peace through introspection and asceticism. Believing that all souls are bound to be endlessly reborn over and over again, it promises its followers a chance to break away from the endless cycle of reincarnation and achieve ethernal bliss in nothingness."
 
 mem_primitives.407.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious development"
 mem_primitives.407.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a a major shift in §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA quasi-religious teaching, combining religious trappings with pseudo-scientific presentation, is gaining popularity among its elites. It teaches that most of the problems that plague the society originate from alien activity in the planet's past, more specifically an alien ruler who commited mass murder of his subjects on the planet's surface. \n\nAllegedly, ghosts of the dead aliens are now haunting [the_planet.GetName], causing mental anguish among the population." 
 mem_primitives.407a:0 "Preposterous. We did no such thing."
 
 #EPIDEMICS
 
 mem_primitives.501.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Plague"
 mem_primitives.501.desc:0 "We are detecting a new strand of highly virulent bacteria on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. The highly contagious disease is spreading across the planet like wildfire and, with medical science as primitive as that of [From.GetName], it can potentially wipe out the entire population. \n\nOf course with our advanced medical knowledge, we would have an easy time stopping its spread, if we were so inclined."
 mem_primitives.501a:0 "Begin developing the cure."
 mem_primitives.501b:0 "We should not interfere."
 mem_primitives.501b.phobe:0 "Things break, xenos die."
 
 mem_primitives.503.name:0 "[from.GetName] wiped out"
 mem_primitives.503.desc:0 "The observation post over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! reports that the last sentient beings on the planet have been wiped out by the plague that ravaged on its surface. §Y[from.GetName]§! is now officially considered extinct and the observation outpost has been dismantled, as there's nothing left to observe. \n\nThe plague is not dangerous to our own citizens, though, so we are free to colonise the planet if we are so inclined."
 mem_primitives.503a.phobe:0 "Things break, xenos die."
 mem_primitives.503a.matphobe:0 "They have lost the game of evolution."
 
 mem_primitives.505.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Plague is over"
 mem_primitives.505.desc:0 "We are no longer seeing any new cases of the plague that used to ravage the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. It likely ran out of viable hosts, leaving behind those who are naturally immune."

 mem_primitives.506.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Cure delivered"
 mem_primitives.506.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has successfully dispersed a synthetic vaccine into the planet's atmosphere designed specifically to counter the plague that is ravaging §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. \n\nWe are expecting the infection rate to drop to zero within a month. The plague is effectively over."
 
 MEM_PRIMITIVES_BD_CURE_PROJECT:0 "Plague vaccination"
 MEM_PRIMITIVES_BD_CURE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The synthetic vaccine designed in our labs could be covertly dispersed into the planet's atmosphere, preventing its primitive population from possibly being wiped out."
 
 #TERROR
 
 mem_primitives.601.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Devastating terrorist attack"
 mem_primitives.601.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! today experienced a significant mass casualty event. Several radicalized citizens had attacked a major cultural and economic center on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! causing possibly the most devastating singular incident in the planet's history. \n\nWith a death toll of thousands and images of burning buildings fresh in the minds of the populace, this event will likely be a turning point in this civilization's history."
 mem_primitives.601a.mil:0 "Looks like someone got tired of diplomacy..."
 mem_primitives.601a.pacphobe:0 "At least we have outgrown such savagery. Right?"
 
 mem_primitives.603.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Atomic terror!"
 mem_primitives.603.desc:0 "Crew of the observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported witnessing a massive explosion today. They were concerned that natives are about to wipe themselves out with nuclear weapons, but it has become clear that this was a singluar incident. Seemingly, a few radicals had stolen a powerful nuclear device from the military and used it to destroy one of the population centres on the planet's surface.\n\nAn event of such proportions will definitely change the history of [From.GetName]."
 
 #Y2K
 
 mem_primitives.701.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Digital disaster"
 mem_primitives.701.desc:0 "The observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! reports witnessing cascade failures in the planet's infrastructure. \n\n§Y[From.GetName]§!, that has relatively recently adopted widespread electronic computers, was apparently ill-prepared to adequately handle date changes, as a change of year number overflowed their variables, resetting the date to zero. \n\nOur researchers report the shutdown of most communication infrastructure and disruption in transportation and utilities, as well as several nuclear power plants going into meltdown. With the emergency code patches being delivered, this event is unlikely to destroy the civilisation, but it will certainly affect their perception of technology."
 mem_primitives.701a:0 "Too bad."
 mem_primitives.701a.sp:0 "They put too much faith into machines."
 mem_primitives.701a.sphobe:0 "They paid the price for relying on soulless machines."
 mem_primitives.701a.mat:0 "Astounding incompetence..."
 mem_primitives.701a.matphile:0 "They will make it through and learn."
