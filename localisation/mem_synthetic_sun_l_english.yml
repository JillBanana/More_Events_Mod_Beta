 mem_synthetic_sun.1.name:0 "This is no moon"
 mem_synthetic_sun.1.desc:0 "Ever since §Y[Root.GetName]§! was colonized, its moon, §Y[the_moon.GetName]§! never seemed quite right to the residents. They couldn't make complete sense out of its orbital mechanics and now they found out why. \n\nBeneath the relatively thin crust, the moon turned out to be filled with strange equipment or alien origin. In fact, the whole moon appears to be artificially construncted millenia ago. \n\nSpeculations fly wild and it might be wise to find out what this equipment is for."
 mem_synthetic_sun.1a:0 "We should explore this further."
 mem_synthetic_sun.1b:0 "Too dangerous. Seal it away."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.2.name:0 "Synthetic sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun.2.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports and astounding discovery [Leader.GetSheHe] made while exploring §Y[the_moon.GetName]§!. \n\nIt appears, the equipment inside the moon is a massive fusion reactor designed to replicate processes inside a star on a small scale. If activated, it would begin sustainable reaction that will supply extra energy to §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! below acting as a second sun, however there's no telling how powerful it would be and how dangerous the attempt actually is. \n\nSome suggest simply scrapping the equipment for raw material and reverse-engineer what we can."
 mem_synthetic_sun.2a:0 "We need to consider our options."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.3.name:0 "Dismantling the synthetic sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun.3.desc:0 "Our personnel had finished scrapping the last of the synthetic sun equipment. Although it's way ahead of our current level of understanding, it had provided us not only with valuable materials, but with invaluable insights into advanced technology as well... \n\nStill, some feel we had missed out on a great opportunity by destroying the synthetic sun."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.4.name:0 "Synthetic sun activated"
 mem_synthetic_sun.4.desc:0 "Crew of [Root.GetName] has successfully finished reactivation of an alien machine inside §Y[the_moon.GetName]§!. \n\nIt's currently in the activation phase and it will take a few months for it to reach full capacity. [Leader.GetName] would rather not stay on the surface when it becomes fully operation."
 mem_synthetic_sun.4a:0 "And now we wait."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.6.name:0 "Synthetic sun on-line"
 mem_synthetic_sun.6.desc:0 "Equipment inside [the_moon.GetName] had successfully reached its full capacity. The crust has collapsed giving way to a big ball of fusion plasma, resembling that of a star. Warm light is reaching the planet below, benefiting our food growth and energy production. \n\nBeing so small, it would not reach true capacity of a star, which is compensated by proximity. It doesn't have longevity of a true star either, and is expected to go out in a mere few millenia."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.7.name:0 "Synthetic sun causes climate shift"
 mem_synthetic_sun.7.changes:0 "Due to continuous influx of energy from the synthetic sun had a profound effect on the planetary climate."
 mem_synthetic_sun.7.cold:0 "$mem_synthetic_sun.7.changes$ \n\nIn overall warmer climate, many glaciers started melting, causing water, once frozen, to return to liquid and vapour states and expand both bodies of war and areas conductive to vegetation growth significantly."
 mem_synthetic_sun.7.wet:0 "$mem_synthetic_sun.7.changes$ \n\nIn overall warmer climate, surface water's vaporisation had hastened up significanly. Areas once covered with lakes and oceans had gave way to dry land, while forested areas shrunk, giving way to deserts."
 mem_synthetic_sun.7a.tooltip:0 "The planet's class had changed."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.8.name:0 "Synthetic sun causes life to flourish"
 mem_synthetic_sun.8.desc:0 "$mem_synthetic_sun.7.changes$ \n\nWith continued well-calibrated supplly of quizi-solar energy, life on the planet had flourished and biodiversity sky-rocketed. [the_planet.GetName] is not more accomodating than ever before."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.9.name:0 "Death sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun.9.desc:0 "Equipment inside [the_moon.GetName] had reached it full capacity. However its output is far from what we were hoping for. \n\nWhenever it was our scientists' mistake or the project was always meant to do this, §Y[Root.GetName]§! is now orbited by a powerful source of hard radiation. It's not something we can't protect our population from, but according to reports, local ecosystems withered and died overnight, making the planet far less hospitable."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.10.name:0 "Synthetic sun overcharge"
 mem_synthetic_sun.10.desc:0 "It's not clear if this is a malfunction or deliberate choice by its creator, but the heat from the fully powered synthetic sun had melted the very crust of [Root.GetName]. \n\nIn a few thousand years, the ball of plasma that was once [the_moon.GetName] will likely cool down, and planet beneath would be colonizable once again. However, until then, it's lost to us."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.11.name:0 "Explosion of synthetic sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun.11.desc:0 "Contrary to our expectations, the sun did not collapse into a ball of plasma as we expected. \n\nInstead, on reaching full capacity, it burned through its entire reserves at once, generating a massive directed burst of energy directed somewhere outside our galaxy. \n\nThis event caused complete failure of the planet's integrity, leaving chunks of it floating in orbit to bombard the planet below."
 mem_synthetic_sun.11a:0 "We just ruined someone's day, didn't we?"
 
 mem_synthetic_sun.12.name:0 "Synthetic sun fizzled out"
 mem_synthetic_sun.12.desc:0 "Unfortunately, the synthetic sun we hoped to activate failed to stabilize its output. \n\nInstead of bursting into a ball of plasma as we hoped, it simply raised its surface temperature a few degrees, then shut down. This time, permanently."
 
 #PROJECTS
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_EXPLORE:0 "Explore the strange moon"
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_EXPLORE_DESC:0 "[the_moon.GetName] is not just a stellar body, but a massive piece of engineering filled by strange machinery. We need to find out what it truly is."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun_chain_title:0 "Synthetic sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun_chain_desc:0 "We had found equipment that could potentially turn a barren moon into a star."
 
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_ACTIVATE:0 "Activate the synthetic sun"
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_ACTIVATE_DESC:0 "We could activate the synthetic sun and find out what it is truly capable of. The risks of activating such a machine are great... But so is the possible reward."
 
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_DISMANTLE:0 "Dismantle the synthetic sun"
 MEM_SYNTHETIC_SUN_DISMANTLE_DESC:0 "We could simply dismantle the equipment, stripping it for materials and valuable data for reverse-engineering, leaving behind a hollowed out shell of a moon. We would avoid risks associated with activating it, but would miss out on possible rewards as well."

 mem_synthetic_sun_modifier_desc:0 "Orbited by a giant ball of plasma, this planet is basking in its soft light increasing energy and food production."
 
 mem_synthetic_sun_radiation:0 "Death sun"
 mem_synthetic_sun_radiation_desc:0 "This planet is orbited by a giant ball of plasma, that is raining hard radiation down on its surface."

 #PLANET CLASS
 pc_mem_synthetic_sun:0 "Synthetic sun"
 pc_mem_synthetic_sun_desc:0 "Big ball of plasma that could be mistaken for a sun if observed from the surface of a planet it orbits. \n\nIn reality it is much dimmer and smaller than an actual star, and would never be able to sustain its reaction if not for advanced technology in its core."
