 mem_viral_engine.10.name:0 "病毒爆發"
 mem_viral_engine.10.desc:0 "[This.GetName]的有關當局匯報當地出現了一種新的疾病，雖然不足以致命，但它仍會對感染者造成精神上的困擾及引致失眠。這次爆發暫時並無大礙，可能只是某些病毒變種。無論如何，我們都要做好預防措施，以免病毒擴散開去，而一眾生物學家正努力尋找病原體。"
 mem_viral_engine.10.a:0 "把感染者進行檢疫隔離。"
 mem_viral_engine.11.name:0 "異常的行為舉止"
 mem_viral_engine.11.desc:0 "靠著眾人的努力不懈，病毒暫時停止了擴散，不過受感染的人卻出現更多病徵。我們收到了不少報告，指感染者性情大變，更有的出手襲擊醫護人員。比起跟隔離區以外的人溝通，他們更熱衷於跟其他感染者交流。在[This.GetName]上的相關人員正忙得不可開交，依然費盡心機去尋找病原體，所以希望獲派更多人手。"
 mem_viral_engine.11.a:0 "立即去辦。"
 mem_viral_engine.11.b:0 "我們沒有時間去理會。"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_ISOLATE_PATHOGEN:0 "緊急狀態"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_ISOLATE_PATHOGEN_DESC:0 "[This.GetName]上醫護人員希望獲派更多人手去調查正感染整個星球的病毒，一艘科學船可以大大幫助他們。"
 mem_viral_engine.12.name:0 "The Infected"
 mem_viral_engine.12.desc:0 "[This.GetName]上關於醫護人員受襲及感染者性情大變的報告有逐漸回落的跡象，不過隔離區內的人突然有強烈衝勁去建造某些東西。他們不知道自己想建造甚麼，或者就算知道也不願意透露。沒有建築經驗的人開始拿起製作工具，教師則挖掘地基，而一群貧民正以一種不知名的十八進制語言編寫著編碼。以現時來看，根本無法得知他們想做甚麼。
 
At this point it is impossible to tell what they are constructing."
 mem_viral_engine.12.generic:0 "Study the infected."
 mem_viral_engine.12.col:0 "Sequester the infected in a camp far from any city."
 mem_viral_engine.12.col.tooltip:0 "The infected population will be removed from the workforce."
 mem_viral_engine.12.phobe:0 "We must protect our people. Sequester the infected!"
 mem_viral_engine.12.phobe.tooltip:0 "The infected population will be removed from the workforce."
 mem_viral_engine.12.mat:0 "We must find a cure. Unleash our best minds."
 mem_viral_engine.12.ind:0 "Cure our people. Nothing must abridge free will."
 mem_viral_engine.12.spi:0 "This may be a voice from Beyond! Observe, but do not interfere."
 mem_viral_engine.12.spiphile:0 "There is a divine beauty in the alien mind. Do not interfere."
 mem_viral_engine.12.phile:0 "This may be an intelligence. We should let them finish."
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_STUDY_INFECTED:0 "Study of the Infected"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_STUDY_INFECTED_DESC:0 "The infected are behaving strangely. They are cooperating with eachother to accomplish some as of yet unknown task. For the safety of our people, we should determine what their final goal is."
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_RESEARCH_CURE:0 "Find the Cure"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_RESEARCH_CURE_DESC:0 "Our people are being manipulated by some kind of alien virus. This cannot continue. We should begin a targetted campaign to find an antiviral medication capable of taking on this threat."
 mem_viral_engine.13.name:0 "Study Concluded"
 mem_viral_engine.13.desc:0 "Analysis of the infected behaviour has concluded in consensus. Those affected by the virus are constructing some kind of incredibly complex biological computer.\n\nOne of the infected approached our staff, claiming to speak for the rest. They claimed that the compulsions had taken the form of voices, and that these voices were telling them that they needed to submit their bodies to some kind of invasive procedure. They requested that we not interfere.\n\nWe have no idea what will happen to our people. This could be our last chance to stop this."
 mem_viral_engine.13.a:0 "Allow them to finish."
 mem_viral_engine.13.a.tooltip:0 "The infected activate their machine. We can only hope it is benign."
 mem_viral_engine.13.b:0 "Stop this at once!"
 mem_viral_engine.13.b.tooltip:0 "Construction will be stopped by whatever means necessary...including deadly force."
 mem_viral_engine.14.name:0 "Successful Isolation"
 mem_viral_engine.14.desc:0 "Our joint efforts with the administration of [This.GetName] have finally isolated the culprit. It is a virus, though one comprised of several amino acids not used in our own biology. It attacks the brain, performing subtle, almost targeted modifications to the areas responsible for decision making and emotional expression. Some of the virologists believe there is a greater intelligence guiding this process."
 mem_viral_engine.14.a:0 "We should consider our options"
 mem_viral_engine.15.name:0 "Out of Time"
 mem_viral_engine.15.desc:0 "Our researchers ran out of time. There are too many unknowns left, and the infected have nearly completed their machine."
 mem_viral_engine.15.a:0 "All we can do is wait...and hope."
 mem_viral_engine.16.name:0 "Isolation Complete"
 mem_viral_engine.16.desc:0 "For the greater good, we have completely removed the infected from our society. They shall be treated and cared for, but they will never be allowed to return. Our people rejoice at their sacrifice."
 mem_viral_engine.16.a:0 "They shall be honored!"
 mem_viral_engine.17.name:0 "Cure Found"
 mem_viral_engine.17.desc:0 "Success! An antiviral has been synthesized to expunge this strange infection. The rest of our populace on [This.GetName] is being inoculated as well, to prevent this from happening again."
 mem_viral_engine.17.a:0 "Another victory for medical science."
 mem_viral_engine.22.name:0 "The Viral Engine"
 mem_viral_engine.22.desc:0 "Construction on [This.GetName] has completed, and our doctors report that there is no trace of the virus left in our people. The machine they built while under its influence is a computer based not on digital data, but on the movement of amino acid and protein groups. It's fascinating, if thoroughly alien.\n\nOur best guess is that the virus built itself a habitat, a persistent simulated environment based on a compatible biological structure. Communication has been made possible through temporary surrogates, and in exchange for power and regular injections of organic material, the machine has offered us its use as a computational engine. Its utility in our research efforts could be immense."
 mem_viral_engine.22.a:0 "Glad this worked out for both sides."
 mem_viral_engine.22.a.tooltip:0 "The §YViral Engine§! is online, benefiting our research."
 mem_viral_engine.19.name:0 "Viral Insurgency"
 mem_viral_engine.19.desc:0 "We have successfully prevented any further activity by the infected. Unfortunately, this caused them to revert to terrifying violence. Local forces were forced to retaliate with lethal force. Some of the infected managed to escape, and may prove to be a threat in the future. But the immediate problem has passed."
 mem_viral_engine.19.a:0 "Hunt them down!"
 mem_viral_engine.20.name:0 "The Viral Transmitter"
 mem_viral_engine.20.desc:0 "The infected have finished construction. The last visible portion was a radio transmitter dish. It activated shortly after completion, putting out a gargantuan amount of data into space. At some point, the virus was completely expunged from the bodies of the infected with an automated inoculation system. Those cured of the disease have returned to their original personalities, and claim almost no memory to what has transpired.\n\nThe current theory is that this device converted the virus' constituent components into coded electronic information, then transmitted this to some unknown location. We're left with more questions than answers, along with a very large, very useless radio transmitter to remove."
 mem_viral_engine.20.a:0 "Good riddance."
 mem_viral_engine.21.name:0 "The Viral Bomb"
 mem_viral_engine.21.desc:0 "The infected's construction project was nothing but a ruse! The building concealed a massive viral dispersal system: a device whose sole purpose was to pour clouds of infectious agents into the atmosphere. An attempt at intervention was met with terrible violence by the infected, and new cases of the virus were reported across the planet. Security forces waged a desperate fight to stop the infected and quarantine those exposed. Cities convulsed with violence, and fires ravaged the world's industrial heartland. They managed to incarcerate or kill most of the insurgents, but some managed to escape into the wilderness. [This.GetName] mourns those lost in this brief but vicious civil war. It must rebuild, but it will never forget."
