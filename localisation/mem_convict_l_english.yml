 MEM_CONVICT_STUDY_POD: "Study the Pod"
 MEM_CONVICT_STUDY_POD_DESC: "The pod found on [the_planet.GetName] has been brought to our capital planet for study. In time, we should be able to understand the inscriptions and maybe even revive the alien inside."

 mem_convict.1.desc: "[Root.GetName] has been able to confirm that the ravine on the surface of [From.GetName] is, indeed, a result of crash landing. The event is estimated to have occured about a thousand years ago. \n\nThe flight crew seems to have perished in the crash, but [Leader.GetName] has disocvered a still functional stasis pod inside the ship. The pod is covered in alien inscriptions we can not yet decypher, but it can be safely detached and studied planetside."

 mem_convict.3.name: "Retheri Rhin"
 mem_convict.3.desc: "The prisoner of the alien pod is now awake. After a brief interrogation he provided an account conflicting with inscription on his pod, claiming to be unjustly imprisoned by the true conspirators within Rendan Federation who sought to destroy everything Rendan people held dear for personal gain. \n\nNow that his civilisation is no longer around, he suggests there's hardly any reason to honor his sentence. He offers his services as an administrator in exchange for pardon."

 mem_convict.4.desc.honest: "The governor [retheri_rhin.GetName] whom we released from a prison pod have proven himself to be a just and upstanding citizen and a competent public servant. Whatever charges were made against him are likely untrue."

 mem_convict.7.desc: "Attention! This is fully-automatic supreme Rendan justice vessel Grim Portent speaking. \n\nYou are harboring a dangerous individual Retheri Rhin who's using your help to evade justice. Do not let him. \n\nTurn him over to me and justice will be served. Rendan people might be dead, but their justice lives in me."
 mem_convict.7.a: "Fine, you can have him."
 mem_convict.7.b: "No way."
