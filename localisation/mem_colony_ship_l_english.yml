 mem_colony_ship.2.desc:0 "Early warning systems have detected an unidentified object rapidly approaching the §Y[the_system.GetName] System§! on sublight speed. \n\nData collected remains inconclusive, but most likely the object is of artificial origin, a vessel of a primitive design that does not respond to any of our warnings or hails. \n\nIts intentions are unknown, but its current path suggests currently unoccupied planet §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! to be its final destination. It is expected to bypass all of our own structures and either crash, land or orbit the planet."
