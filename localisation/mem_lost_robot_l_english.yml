# Initial Event
mem_lost_robot.1.name:0 "A Lost Robot"
 mem_lost_robot.1.desc:0 "Administrators of the [Root.GetName] moon's mining station are reporting that a 'AL' model robot is missing from the last shipment we sent them.\n\nThey ask us to investigate and send it to the Moon so it can start his mining duty."
 mem_lost_robot.1.accept:0 "They must be mistaking. Check the delivery manifest."
 mem_lost_robot.1.deny:0 "It's a single missing robot. They will do without it."

# Retrieve the robot
mem_lost_robot.2.name:0 "A Lost Robot"
 mem_lost_robot.2.desc:0 "After checking the flight manifest and the receipt, it appears there's really a missing robot in the last shipment.\n\nWe see two options here. Either it has been left somewhere in the space cargo that was used to send it to the moon or it has never quit the planet and it is still somewhere in the factory that produced it."
 mem_lost_robot.2.cargo:0 "Check the space cargo hold."
 mem_lost_robot.2.factory:0 "Check the factory stocks."

# Check the cargo - Delayed
mem_lost_robot.10.name:0 "Nothing in the Cargo"
 mem_lost_robot.10.desc:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo. Even worst, we lost quite some time in our research as we had to wait for the cargo to return from another delivery.\n\nWe could now try to check the factory as we know it has never been on board of this space cargo."
 mem_lost_robot.10.factory:0 "Yes, look at the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.10.abandon:0 "It's not worth our time. Cancel the research."
 
# Check the cargo - Normal
mem_lost_robot.11.name:0 "Nothing in the Cargo"
 mem_lost_robot.11.desc.first:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo. We could now try to check the factory as we know it has never been on board of this space cargo."
 mem_lost_robot.11.desc.second:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo as well. Maybe we should try to look at [Root.GetName]'s surface as a last resort. If the robot somehow escaped, it might still be in the surroundings of the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.11.factory:0 "Yes, look at the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.11.planet:0 "Alright, look at the planet."
 mem_lost_robot.11.abandon:0 "It's not worth our time. Cancel the research."

# Check the factory
mem_lost_robot.20.name:0 "Nothing in the Factory"
 mem_lost_robot.20.desc.first:0 "After much time spent checking the factory on [Root.GetName], we are sure that the robot is not present there anymore. It is possible it has been forgoten in the space cargo so that might be interesting to check it."
 mem_lost_robot.20.desc.second:0 "After much time spent checking the factory on [Root.GetName], we can assure that the robot is not present there anymore. Maybe we should try to look at [Root.GetName]'s surface as a last resort. If the robot somehow escaped, it might still be in the surroundings of the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.20.cargo:0 "Ok, investigate the cargo."
 mem_lost_robot.20.planet:0 "Good. Check the planet's surface."
 mem_lost_robot.20.abandon:0 "Stop wasting resources. Cancel the research."

# Robot retrieved 
mem_lost_robot.30.name:0 "Robot Retrieved"
 mem_lost_robot.30.desc.cargo:0 "After checking the cargo from top to bottom, we finally found the robot that got stuck in a janitor's room after he escaped the cargo hold. We will send it to reprogramming before sending it to the moon."
 mem_lost_robot.30.desc.factory:0 "After a thorough search of all the immense factory, we found the robot stuck under a conveyor belt. We don't know how he ended here nor why he left his place but we will send it to reprogramming before sending it to the moon."

# Disinto fired 
mem_lost_robot.101.name:0 "Tragedy"
 mem_lost_robot.101.desc:0 "We finally found the robot. Apparently, he fled from the factory before embarking in the cargo that should have sent it to the moon. He then stood hidden on [Root.GetName] to build a mining equipment called a Disinto like he was supposed to do on the moon.\n\nUnfortunately, once fired, he created a massive crater destroying everything in a really large perimeter and killing all the population in the surrounding area. Judging by the size of the crater, he must have improved the initial Disinto's design to be able to deliver such power. Contrary to the machine, the robot itself survived the shockwave but he lost all his memory in the process so we cannot retrieve the plan for this improved mining device."
 mem_lost_robot.101.a:0 "This is a tragedy."
 mem_lost_robot_101.tooltip:0 "A massive crater has been created on the planet's surface, killing all the surrounding population and destroying our installations."

# Robot found with broken disinto
mem_lost_robot.102.name:0 "Useless Find"
 mem_lost_robot.102.desc.luck:0 "Locals on [Root.GetName] have reported they have spotted a lonely robot in the wild. Following the reports, we have found the missing 'AL' model in a forest clearing. He had completely lost his mind and apparently, he was trying to build a mining device called a Disinto but we arrived on time before he fired it. That would have been a disaster if we had never found him."
 mem_lost_robot.102.desc:0 "After our extensive research, we finally found the robot. It was a malfunctionning unit that was trying to build a mining equipment called a Disinto. Fortunately, the device was as malfunctionning as his creator so we avoided a potential tragedy."
 mem_lost_robot.102.a:0 "Scrap it for material."

# Robot found with working disinto
mem_lost_robot.103.name:0 "Lucky Find"
 mem_lost_robot.103.desc.luck:0 "Locals on [Root.GetName] have reported they have spotted a lonely robot in the wild. Following the reports, we have found the missing 'AL' model in a forest clearing. We also found a Disinto, a mining equipment used on [Root.GetName]'s moon that the robot had been building.\n\nAfter close examination, it appears that the robot improved the Disinto's design to an extent we couldn't have imagined and early estimation reports that using this new design would help us increase our mineral production comfortably."
 mem_lost_robot.103.desc:0 "After our extensive research, we finally found the robot. We also found a Disinto, a mining equipment used on [Root.GetName]'s moon that the robot had been building.\n\nAfter close examination, it appears that the robot improved the Disinto's design to an extent we couldn't have imagined and early estimation reports that using this new design would help us increase our mineral production comfortably."
 mem_lost_robot.103.a:0 "That will be really useful."

 # Modifier
