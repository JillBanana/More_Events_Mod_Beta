 mem_last_orila_1_chain_desc:0 "Ages ago the Orila fleet had been lured into a trap by their enemies. The system's star had been brought to collapse resulting in an enormous explosion ripping apart their ships.\n\nChap'Lin himself who at that point commanded the orila flagship was among the few survivors. The other ships were completely obliterated but the "Pride of Harilla" though heavily damaged withstood the blast. It had to be evacuated and could not be retrieved ever since.\n\nIn its at that time already weakened state their empire was unable to recover from this loss which led to their ultimate demise.\n\nHow their enemies who where significantly less advanced in their technology had been able to collapse that star in the first place remained unknown to the Orila. Though hidden assistance by an outside force was the most likely explanation. Today this seems to be of no importance anymore. But the wreckage might still be there. If we were to recover and restore it, it would surely benefit the protection of our people."

According to him the coordinates attached to this message might lead us to where the decisive defeat which led to the demise of the Orila took place.\n\nMore detailed information will be available in the situation log."
