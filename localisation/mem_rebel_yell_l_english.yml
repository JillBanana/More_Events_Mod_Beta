 mem_rebel_yell.1.desc: "[From.GetName] System appears to contain remainders of a massive engagement. \n\nDespite battle taking place a long time ago, the space is still littered by large number of orbital debris. But there's something more to this system. \n\n[Root.GetName] reports that it has detected a faint signal being broadcast the system, but despite all efforts it could not identify its source. Investigating the source of a signal would require more powerful and precise equipment, best placed on a stationary outpost."

 mem_rebel_yell.3.desc: "Our investigation of [the_planet.GetName] got results. [Root.GetName] was able to fully record and decypher the signal originating from the [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThe signal is a military broadcast adressed towards "Resistance Ships" passing through the system. \n\n From what [Leader.GetName] can gather, [the_system.GetName] was a site of a massive defeat for said Resistance about two thousands years ago, and the forces fought against has all but completely obliterated them. \n\nThe broadcast instructed survivors to withdraw to a system. However the coordiates of the system do not match hyperlane network as it is known for us. Are they wrong, or there's another way to get there?"

 mem_rebel_yell.4.desc: "Our insight into encrypted signal broadcast across the [the_system.GetName] System has allowed us to see past some kind of jamming, concealing a wormhole on the outskirts of the system. Perhaps this is the way to reach the coordinates from the encrypted message?"
 mem_rebel_yell.4.a: "We should investigate this wormhole."
