 mem_blacksite.2.name:0 "Access Request"
 mem_blacksite.2.desc:0 "Greetings. \n\nAn effort of galactic importance requires your cooperation. A particularly sensitive project is being conducted and we would prefer to not conduct it within our own borders. A planet within system you control, §Y[blacksite_planet.GetName]§! is of no value for you, so it would be perfect for this. \n\nIt would be better for all if you didn't try to interfere with operations of our blacksite, and allow our shuttles free passage in and out. \n\nThis is not a request we make lightly, and this is an opportunity for you to not only contribute to noble goal, but also earn good relationship with us."
 mem_blacksite.2.a:0 "Very well. You can have your blacksite."
 mem_blacksite.2.a.tooltip:0 "§Y[blacksite_planet.GetName]§! will be housing a blacksite, operated by [blacksite_fallen_empire.GetName]. From now on it will be known as §YFacility Six§!. \nDespite their promises, this project might have §Runexpected consequences§!."
 mem_blacksite.2.b:0 "We can not allow this."
 mem_blacksite.2.c:0 "What exactly do you intend to do there?"
 mem_blacksite.2.c.response:0 "A project of great importance. Don't worry, we are not going to place you in any danger. We promise."

 mem_blacksite.400.name:0 "Blacksite Withdrawal"
 mem_blacksite.400.desc:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesName]! Good news. The project that we were conducting within your territory is officially concluded. \n\nNot only did it end with great success, we have also managed to avoid complete destruction of any of your systems. Isn't it wonderful? \n\nYou were an exemplary collaborator, and for your contribution you deserve to be rewarded."
 mem_blacksite.400.a:0 "All is well that ends well."

 mem_blacksite.500.name:0 "Massive Explosion on [blacksite_planet.GetName]"
 mem_blacksite.500.desc:0 "Planet §Y[blacksite_planet.GetName]§! that used to host a blacksite operated by §Y[blacksite_fallen_empire.GetName]§! had experienced a massive detonation, followed by complete shattering of the planet. The reason for this is unknown, but fragments of equipment used in the blacksite operation can still be found within the debris field."
 mem_blacksite.500.a:0 "Worrying."
 mem_blacksite.500.a.tooltip:0 "§Y[blacksite_planet.GetName]§! had exploded and became a §Sshattered world§!"

 mem_blacksite.501.name:0 "Blacksite Report"
 mem_blacksite.501.desc:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesName]! Don't be alarmed. \n\nWe are aware that [blacksite_planet] had exploded. This is fine. This is normal. Planets do this all the time, beleive me. \n\nIt's over, anyway. We are done there."
 mem_blacksite.501.a:0 "Fine."
 mem_blacksite.501.b:0 "You blew up our planet. We deserve an explaination."
 mem_blacksite.501.b.response:0 "You impudent brat. You get nothing and like it."

However before the planet was completely destroyed, a small flotilla of unidentified ships had taken off. It is, at the moment, unclear what their origin and purpose was, but their behaviour so far indicates less than friendly intentions."
 mem_blacksite.700.a:0 "Prepare to clear the system out."
 mem_blacksite.700.b:0 "Contact [blacksite_fallen_empire.GetName] and demand an explaination"

 mem_blacksite.701.name:0 "In Response to Your Querry"
 mem_blacksite.701.desc:0 "You are very observant. It is true that our blacksite on §Y[blacksite_planet.GetName]§! had caused complete destruction of a planet. And it is true that a handful of... well, let's not dwell on what they are... had escaped this explosion instead of being destroyed like they are supposed to, and are now poised to take hostile action against you. \n\nNow, I know what you are probably thinking. "Their reckless experiments had endagered us all!" First of all, it's rude to think such things about your elders. We were doing this while you were still banging rocks together. \n\nSecond, this was a sacrifice worth making. What is a single backwater system compared to the future of the entire galaxy? \n\nAnd finally, you are not really in danger. The probes are not equiped with any kind of hyperdrives and are not smart enough to build one. We think. \n\nIf you actually notice them building a hyperdrive, please contact us - because that might actually be a problem. But we are positive they can't do it. Absolutely positive."
 mem_blacksite.701.a:0 "View screen off."
 mem_blacksite.701.b:0 "What were you doing down there?"
