 mem_death_world.1.name:0 "Dangerous Awakening"
 mem_death_world.1.desc:0 "Previously benign ecosystem on §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to be undergoing rapid change. Multiple previously docile native creatures are becoming more hostile to our colonists and attacking. Dozens reports of injuries overnight accompany the sudden rise of aggression and threaten to overwhelm planetary healthcare system if the trend continues."
 
 mem_death_world.2.name:0 "Ransacked Storage"
 mem_death_world.2.desc:0 "Large number of small native rodents have somehow found its way into one of the planetary storage facilities on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Despite their small size, they have caused considerable damage to sensitive equipment stored there, many items need to be replaced as soon as possible."
 
 mem_death_world.3.name:0 "Civilian Injuries"
 mem_death_world.3.desc:0 "Citizens on §Y[Root.GetName]§! were warned to remain indoor, but this time it wasn't enough. A habitat block was infiltrated by venomous creatures who emerged from ventilation shafts stinging residents. Despite lack of fatalities, citizens are quite distressed by the event and some of the victims might have to spend a significant time recovering."
 mem_death_world.3a:0 "Nasty vermin."
 
 mem_death_world.4.name:0 "Plague of Insects"
 mem_death_world.4.desc:0 "Large number of large insects had emerged from the ground all over §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Although hardly dangerous on their own, large numbers of them threaten to disrupt infrastructure on the planet, with their hard carapaces clogging the utilities and engines of planetside vehicles."
 mem_death_world.4a:0 "Disgusting bugs."
 
 mem_death_world.5.name:0 "Wildlife Agression Grows"
 mem_death_world.5.desc:0 "We are getting the first reports from §Y[Root.GetName]§! of local wildlife actively hunting and killing colonists. The casualty rate is low, but it grows, and the trend can not be ignored. The native organisms show rapid change in phenotypes as they adapt to our tactics and methods faster than any evolutionary model could predict."
 mem_death_world.5a:0 "Something has to be done."
 
 mem_death_world.6.name:0 "Survivalist Militia"
 mem_death_world.6.desc:0 "Concerned about their future on the planet, many colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! have chosen to dedicate their time to study weapons and wildlife survival techniques in case native life keeps its offensive. The survivalist movement is gaining new members with every day."
 mem_death_world.6a:0 "Support the initiative."
 mem_death_world.6b:0 "Allow the initiative."
 mem_death_world.6c:0 "Discourage the initiative."
 
 mem_death_world.7.name:0 "Death Swarm"
 mem_death_world.7.desc:0 "Today large swarm of unusually violent beetles had descended from the skies of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Before authorities could react, multiple civilian workers were bitten many times and soon succumbed to deadly venom."
 
 mem_death_world.8.name:0 "Stampede"
 mem_death_world.8.desc:0 "Multiple large previously docile mammals had amassed today and attacked one of facilities on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. They had rammed its walls multiple time with their hammer-shaped heads until the sheer strain had caused a collapse. The creatures then trampled the ruins so more before fleeing into the wilderness. At least workers were able to flee and civilian casualties were kept to minimum."
 mem_death_world.8a:0 "They need to be stopped."
 
 mem_death_world.9.name:0 "Nature's Revenge"
 mem_death_world.9.desc:0 "The native life on §Y[Root.GetName]§! grows more aggressive and organized with every day. They are able to execute complex manoeuvres and evade our forces. The planet is now borderline death world, where simple everyday survival is a monumental task."
 mem_death_world.9a:0 "We need to find a way to stop it before its too late."
 
 mem_death_world.10.name:0 "Purity Movement"
 mem_death_world.10.desc:0 "The colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had enough traumatic experience with alien life to turn them extremely distrustful to all that is not like them. The xenophobic movement is on the rise."
 mem_death_world.10a:0 "Troubling."
 mem_death_world.10b:0 "They know what's good for them."

 mem_death_world.11.name:0 "Looking for a solution"
 mem_death_world.11.desc:0 "The ongoing situation on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has prompted many experts to propose the solution to the crisis. As the wildlife aggression grows, the need to do something is clear. We only need to choose what."
 mem_death_world.11a:0 "We must look into ways to destroy the aggressors."
 mem_death_world.11b:0 "We must study the wildlife more closely."
 mem_death_world.11c:0 "We should find a way to bunker down and hope for the best."
 mem_death_world.11d:0 "The force behind the wildlife aggression must be psionic. We could tap in it."
 mem_death_world.11e:0 "Those creatures are like us. We should study this."
 
 mem_death_world.12.name:0 "War on Nature"
 mem_death_world.12.desc:0 "Extensive research into the hostile ecosystem on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had revealed several vulnerable points that would disrupt the whole if struck. Military commanders propose two possible solutions: \n\nBy deploying a specific weapon from safe orbit, tailored to destroy the wildlife, they could execute the plan safely but collateral damage would be enormous. \n\nGround operation has less chance of success and would likely require off-world reinforcements, but should keep the planet's gaia potential intact."
 mem_death_world.12a:0 "Let's consider our options"
 
 mem_death_world.13.name:0 "Wildlife removal"
 mem_death_world.13.desc:0 "Our predictions were true. When struck with our advanced weapon, the entire hostile econsystem has collapsed. \n\nHowever, the solution was not without side-effects. Massive sudden destruction of entire planet's overgrown ecosystem had released energy forcing climate change and turning the world into a wasteland."
 mem_death_world.13a:0 "At least it's our wasteland."
 
 mem_death_world.14.name:0 "Extermination of Bust"
 mem_death_world.14.desc:0 "Local ecosystem has sensed our agression. They are preparing to attack!"
 mem_death_world.14a:0 "Prepare to fight!"
 
 mem_death_world.15.name:0 "Our forces were victorious"
 mem_death_world.15.desc:0 "As analysts anticipated, multiple strikes at weak points had disrupted the ecosystem enough to cause a massive collapse. Almost all niches had been disrupted and starved and disoriented creatures are making easy target for our mop-up operations."
 mem_death_world.15a:0 "We have taken the planet back."
 
 mem_death_world.16.name:0 "Our forces have lost"
 mem_death_world.16.desc:0 "We had anticipated the resistance from wildlife, but we did not anticipate this. Our own forces were routed and exterminated. \n\nSeemingly spurred by our aggression, the ecosystem rapidly changed towards exhaling toxic gases into the atmosphere, quickly and hostilely changing its composition and turning it uninhabitable."
 
 mem_death_world.17.name:0 "Comprehensive wildlife study"
 mem_death_world.17.desc:0 "Extensive sampling and autopsy of hostile wildlife on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had proven to be quite valuable in understanding its nature. \n\nDespite being separate and genetically distinct species, all appear to have foreign material stuck in their tissues, somehow bonding them together. Constant immune suppression prevents the host's antibodies from targeting it. Understanding this effect has opened our eyes to possible ways to solve our problems."
 mem_death_world.17a:0 "What if we use the tissue to help our colonists be in peace with the planet?"
 mem_death_world.17b:0 "What if we find a way to disrupt the immune suppression?"
 
 mem_death_world.18.name:0 "In harmony with the nature"
 mem_death_world.18.desc:0 "The first test subjects had shown amazing potential to control and direct the strange tissue that bond together the wildlife on this planet. They were able to avoid being attacked by the native species. Soon enough, safe and easy tissue implants were distributed among the population. \n\nThe tissue had been not without side effects. The subjects find it hard to operate off-world, but it's a small price to pay for control of the planet. The newly formed symbiosis had accelerated the wildlife spread, turning the planet into a strange new world hostile to all but few who let the bond tissue inside them."
 mem_death_world.18a:0 "Fascinating."
 
 mem_death_world.19.name:0 "Immune suicide"
 mem_death_world.19.desc:0 "A small but effective strand of viral agent - one thing that native life of §Y[Root.GetName]§! could not adapt to. A pandemic spreading across the native creatures populations causing fatal rejection chain reaction in their organisms. Soon enough, all the dangerous creatures have died out."
 mem_death_world.19a:0 "Perfect."
 
 mem_death_world.20.name:0 "Walled Garden"
 mem_death_world.20.desc:0 "Our engineers had laid out a plan to protect colonists' habitats from growing dangers and pacify the native wildlife without having to openly confront them. A combination with earthquake simulating hammer installations, electromagnetic-based disruptors and sonic fences we should be able to deter any further activity in our areas."
 mem_death_world.20a:0 "Prepare construction"
 mem_death_world.20.tooltip:0 "We can now build §YDeterrence hub§! that will stop the infestation."
 
 mem_death_world.21.name:0 "Deterrence Hub is now operational"
 mem_death_world.21.desc:0 "We have successfully deployed our defences. Although some areas are not viable to defend with it and had to be abandoned, the rest should be safe from further incursions."
 mem_death_world.21a:0 "Let there be peace in our time."

 mem_death_world.22.name:0 "Deterrence Hub demolished"
 mem_death_world.22.desc:0 "With our careless decision to demoish the §YDeterrence hub§! on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we have allowed native life to rise against us. The colony was overrun within an hour."

 mem_death_world.23.name:0 "Psionic presence"
 mem_death_world.23.desc:0 "We were right! The wildlife does have a collective mind guiding it, facilitated by psionic activity. It seems that a growth deep beneath the surface is acting as a giant mind, guiding the planet's life through pieces of its flesh that infect them. This should allow us to communicate with... or destroy it by other means."
 mem_death_world.23a:0 "Psionically link with the planetary mind."
 mem_death_world.23b:0 "Use the newfound knowledge to strike at the root of the problem."

 mem_death_world.24.name:0 "Planetmind pacified"
 mem_death_world.24.desc:0 "Multiple psionic experts from our empire had travelled to §Y[Root.GetName]§! to engage with the mind that guides it. Their collective wills had wormed their way into psionic connection that runs through the planet's ecosystem. Overwhelmed by this mental attack, the planetmind was not able to resist and had been successfully pacificed, its bestial will rewritten to our ends."
 mem_death_world.24a:0 "Our will is strong."

 mem_death_world.25.name:0 "Planetmind victorious"
 mem_death_world.25.desc:0 "Multiple psionic experts from our empire had travelled to §Y[Root.GetName]§! to engage with the mind that guides it. Their collective wills had wormed their way into psionic connection that runs through the planet's ecosystem. Unfortunately, the planetmind was stronger than they expected. \n\nNot only it destroyed their minds whole, it had learned from them how to attack colonists' minds directly. Soon most of the colony was under its control. Apparently worried of further attacks, it had changed biocycle of the life to produce atmosphere unsuitable for us and soon the colony was lost to us permanently."

 mem_death_world.26.name:0 "Root of all Evil"
 mem_death_world.26.desc:0 "With planetmind structure mapped out by the psionic experts, our scientists were able to locate several major metabolic nodes, that power the whole system. With several tonnes of highly potent neurotoxin injected inside those nodes via a massive drilling platforms, we were able to watch in real time as the planetmind veins withered and died while life on the surface returned back to normal."
 mem_death_world.26a:0 "Victory is ours!"
 mem_death_world.26b:0 "Such tragic loss. But we had no choice."
