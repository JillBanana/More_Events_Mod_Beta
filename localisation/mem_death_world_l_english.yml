  mem_death_world_LOST:0 "The planet is lost."
 
 mem_death_world.1.name:0 "Dangerous Awakening"
 mem_death_world.1.desc:0 "Previously benign ecosystem on §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to be undergoing rapid change. Multiple previously docile native creatures are becoming more hostile to our colonists and attacking. Dozens reports of injuries overnight accompany the sudden rise of aggression and threaten to overwhelm planetary healthcare system if the trend continues."
 
 mem_death_world.2.name:0 "Ransacked Storage"
 mem_death_world.2.desc:0 "Large number of small native rodents have somehow found its way into one of the planetary storage facilities on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Despite their small size, they have caused considerable damage to sensitive equipment stored there, many items need to be replaced as soon as possible."
 
 mem_death_world.3.name:0 "Civilian Injuries"
 mem_death_world.3.desc:0 "Citizens on §Y[Root.GetName]§! were warned to remain indoor, but this time it wasn't enough. A habitat block was infiltrated by venomous creatures who emerged from ventilation shafts stinging residents. Despite lack of fatalities, citizens are quite distressed by the event and some of the victims might have to spend a significant time recovering."
 mem_death_world.3a:0 "Nasty vermin."
 
 mem_death_world.4.name:0 "Plague of Insects"
 mem_death_world.4.desc:0 "Large number of large insects had emerged from the ground all over §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Although hardly dangerous on their own, large numbers of them threaten to disrupt infrastructure on the planet, with their hard carapaces clogging the utilities and engines of planetside vehicles."
 mem_death_world.4a:0 "Disgusting bugs."
 
 mem_death_world.5.name:0 "Wildlife Agression Grows"
 mem_death_world.5.desc:0 "We are getting the first reports from §Y[Root.GetName]§! of local wildlife actively hunting and killing colonists. The casualty rate is low, but it grows, and the trend can not be ignored. The native organisms show rapid change in phenotypes as they adapt to our tactics and methods faster than any evolutionary model could predict."
 mem_death_world.5a:0 "Something has to be done."
 
 mem_death_world.6.name:0 "Survivalist Militia"
 mem_death_world.6.desc:0 "Concerned about their future on the planet, many colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! have chosen to dedicate their time to study weapons and wildlife survival techniques in case native life keeps its offensive. The survivalist movement is gaining new members with every day."
 mem_death_world.6a:0 "Support the initiative."
 mem_death_world.6b:0 "Allow the initiative."
 mem_death_world.6c:0 "Discourage the initiative."
 
 mem_death_world.7.name:0 "Death Swarm"
 mem_death_world.7.desc:0 "Today large swarm of unusually violent beetles had descended from the skies of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Before authorities could react, multiple civilian workers were bitten many times and soon succumbed to deadly venom."
 
 mem_death_world.8.name:0 "Stampede"
 mem_death_world.8.desc:0 "Multiple large previously docile mammals had amassed today and attacked one of facilities on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. They had rammed its walls multiple time with their hammer-shaped heads until the sheer strain had caused a collapse. The creatures then trampled the ruins so more before fleeing into the wilderness. At least workers were able to flee and civilian casualties were kept to minimum."
 mem_death_world.8a:0 "They need to be stopped."
 
 mem_death_world.9.name:0 "Nature's Revenge"
 mem_death_world.9.desc:0 "The native life on §Y[Root.GetName]§! grows more aggressive and organized with every day. They are able to execute complex manoeuvres and evade our forces. The planet is now borderline death world, where simple everyday survival is a monumental task."
 mem_death_world.9a:0 "We need to find a way to stop it before its too late."
 
 mem_death_world.10.name:0 "Purity Movement"
 mem_death_world.10.desc:0 "The colonists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had enough traumatic experience with alien life to turn them extremely distrustful to all that is not like them. The xenophobic movement is on the rise."
 mem_death_world.10a:0 "Troubling."
 mem_death_world.10b:0 "They know what's good for them."

 mem_death_world.11.name:0 "Looking for a solution"
 mem_death_world.11.desc:0 "The ongoing situation on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has prompted many experts to propose the solution to the crisis. As the wildlife aggression grows, the need to do something is clear. We only need to choose what."
 mem_death_world.11a:0 "We must look into ways to destroy the aggressors."
 mem_death_world.11b:0 "We must study the wildlife more closely."
 mem_death_world.11c:0 "We should find a way to bunker down and hope for the best."
 mem_death_world.11d:0 "The force behind the wildlife aggression must be psionic. We could tap in it."
 mem_death_world.11e:0 "Those creatures are like us. We should study this."
 
 mem_death_world.12.name:0 "War on Nature"
 mem_death_world.12.desc:0 "Extensive research into the hostile ecosystem on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had revealed several vulnerable points that would disrupt the whole if struck. Military commanders propose two possible solutions: \n\nBy deploying a specific weapon from safe orbit, tailored to destroy the wildlife, they could execute the plan safely but collateral damage would be enormous. \n\nGround operation has less chance of success and would likely require off-world reinforcements, but should keep the planet's gaia potential intact."
 mem_death_world.12a:0 "Let's consider our options"
 
 mem_death_world.13.name:0 "Wildlife removal"
 mem_death_world.13.desc:0 "Our predictions were true. When struck with our advanced weapon, the entire hostile econsystem has collapsed. \n\nHowever, the solution was not without side-effects. Massive sudden destruction of entire planet's overgrown ecosystem had released energy forcing climate change and turning the world into a wasteland."
 mem_death_world.13a:0 "At least it's our wasteland."
 
 mem_death_world.14.name:0 "Extermination of Bust"
 mem_death_world.14.desc:0 "Local ecosystem has sensed our agression. They are preparing to attack!"
 mem_death_world.14a:0 "Prepare to fight!"
 
 mem_death_world.15.name:0 "Our forces were victorious"
 mem_death_world.15.desc:0 "As analysts anticipated, multiple strikes at weak points had disrupted the ecosystem enough to cause a massive collapse. Almost all niches had been disrupted and starved and disoriented creatures are making easy target for our mop-up operations."
 mem_death_world.15a:0 "We have taken the planet back."
 
 mem_death_world.16.name:0 "Our forces have lost"
 mem_death_world.16.desc:0 "We had anticipated the resistance from wildlife, but we did not anticipate this. Our own forces were routed and exterminated. \n\nSeemingly spurred by our aggression, the ecosystem rapidly changed towards exhaling toxic gases into the atmosphere, quickly and hostilely changing its composition and turning it uninhabitable."

 mem_death_world_chain_title:0 "Death World"
 mem_death_world_chain_desc:0 "In the face of ever increasing agression from local ecosystem, we need to find a way to solve the crisis on the so-called "Death World", before it lives up to its moniker."
 
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_WAR_ON_NATURE:0 "Observe the wildlife behaviour"
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_WAR_ON_NATURE_DESC:0 "Our scientists should observe the planet from orbit, looking for weak points to strike."
 
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_WILDLIFE_REMOVAL:0 "Wildlife removal"
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_WILDLIFE_REMOVAL_DESC:0 "Powerful weapon deployed from orbit, tailored to disrupt the alien ecosystem. It will probably destroy the planet, but it will definitely neutralize the threat."
 
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_EXTERMINATION_OR_BUST:0 "Extermination or Bust!"
 MEM_DEATH_WORLD_EXTERMINATION_OR_BUST_DESC:0 "Boots on the ground solution should allow us to destroy the hostile ecosystem, while keeping planet's gaia potential intact. \n\n§RWe have one chance at this! If our planetside armies are not strong enough to carry out the strike, we will likely lose the planet for good.§!"
