 mem_antarans_raided:0 "Was target of an ANTARAN raid."
 mem_antarans_raided_desc:0 "This planet has been devastated during a brutal raid by the ANTARANS. It will take a long time to recover from this rutheless blow."
 
 #Rift opens
 mem_antarans.4.name:0 "A Subspace Rift is Forming"
 #first rift ever seen in own territory
 mem_antarans.4a.desc:0 "An enormous energy spike has been reported by local sensor stations in the [mem_antarans_target_sun.GetName] system. First reports describe its source as a rift in space. A hole in reality.\n\nSystem defense is in high alert and local authorities request immediate assistance by our naval forces."
 #every later standard rift encounter
 mem_antarans.4b.desc:0 "Sensor stations in the [mem_antarans_target_sun.GetName] system report about a new subspace rift forming. Our fleet has already been put on high alert. We should prepare for the worst."
 #retaliation rift encounter
 mem_antarans.4c.desc:0 "Sensor stations in the [mem_antarans_target_sun.GetName] system report about a giant subspace rift forming. Judging by its size there is a storm coming. We should prepare for the worst."
 #response in first encounter
 mem_antarans.4.a:0 "Issue an investigation of this anomaly."
 #response in later encounter
 mem_antarans.4.a:0 "Get the fleet ready."
 #response in retaliation encounter
 mem_antarans.4.a:0 "We shall not waver."
 
 #Rift opens and fleet spawns
 mem_antarans.5.name:0 "We Are Under Attack"
 #first encounter
 mem_antarans.5a.desc:0 "The rift has formed some kind of portal. Ships of unknown design have begun to pour out of it. All communication attempts are being blocked and their fleet has laid a direct course for our colony. We must assume they are hostile."
 #after first encounter has happened before
 mem_antarans.5b.desc:0 "The portal has formed and hostile contacte have been confirmed moving towards our colony. This seems to be another one of their raiding fleets."
 #retaliation encounter
 mem_antarans.5c.desc:0 "A giant portal has formed unleashing an enormous fleet. It is heading directly for our homeworld."
 #response in first encounter
 mem_antarans.5.a:0 "Who are they?"
 #response in later encounter
 mem_antarans.5.b:0 "Protect the colony."
 #response in retaliation encounter
 mem_antarans.5.c:0 "Defend [root.Capital.GetName] at all cost!"
 
 #Information event about a known empire being attacked

 #Information event about an unknown empire being attacked
 mem_antarans.21.name:0 "Turmoil in the Galaxy"
 mem_antarans.21a.desc:0 "Traders tell about ongoing attacks on various empires we have not yet established contact with. The attackers are reported to be very well equipped."
 mem_antarans.21b.desc:0 "Open subspace communication channels are yet again being flooded with reports about ANTARAN raids."
 
 #Finding a destroyed Planet
 mem_antarans.200.name:0 "Devastation"
 #haven't seen anything antaran related so far
 mem_antarans.200a.desc:0 "Upon reaching the [From.GetName] system sensores revealed that on of its planets has been broken into pieces. It is unclear what lead to its current state. Further investigation is recommended."
 #only seen another destroyed planet so far
 mem_antarans.200b.desc:0 "We have come across another broken world. A brief scan of its vicinity reveals traces of the same heavy element alloys we have found before. This planet must have fallen victim to the same force."
 #already met the antarans and seen a destroyed planet
 mem_antarans.200c.desc:0 "We have come across another broken world. A brief scan of its vicinity reveals traces of the same heavy element alloys used by the ANTARANS. Another world fallen victim to their reign of terror."
 
 MEM_ANTARANS_BROKEN_PLANET_INVESTIGATION:0 "A Destroyed World"
 MEM_ANTARANS_BROKEN_PLANET_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "A long term investigation of this site should provide us with more insight into what might have happened to this planet."
 
 #Finished Project on first broken world
 mem_antarans.201.name:0 "Apocalypse"
 #not met antarans before
 mem_antarans.201a.desc:0 "After studying what remains of this world chief scientist [root.Leader.GetName] and [root.Leader.GetHerHis] colleagues came to a concerning conclusion. Given all available information the current state of [From.From.GetName] is the result of cataclysmic orbital bombardement. In the vicinity of this site traces of superheavy elements which do not naturally occur can be found. Though who did this and why remains a mystery."
 #met antarans before
 mem_antarans.201b.desc:0 "After studying what remains of this world chief scientist [root.Leader.GetName] and [root.Leader.GetHerHis] colleagues came to a concerning conclusion. Given all available information the current state of [From.GetName] is the result of cataclysmic orbital bombardement. In the vicinity of this site traces of superheavy elements unique to ANTARAN technology can be found. It appears as if they set an example here. No traces of a supposed civilization formerly native to this world can be found."
 mem_antarans.201.a:0 "Concerning."
 
 #Anomaly
 mem_antarans_category:0 "Covered in Craters"
 mem_antarans_category_desc:0 "Though it is not unsual for barren planets to feature the results of many cosmic impacts, in this case the pattern of craters appears to be too regular to occur naturally."
 
 #Anomaly success 1
 mem_antarans.202.name:0 "The End of a World"
 mem_antarans.202.desc:0  "While conducting a series of low altitude survey flights to study the crater sites using a shuttlecraft, our scientists received a weak self-repeating transmission originating from well below the debris. [root.Leader.GetName], though being able to pinpoint its source, quickly discarded the idea of trying to reach it as too dangerous.\n\nBack aboard the [root.GetName], [root.Leader.GetSheHe] managed to decipher the recorded transmission.\n\nIt consisted of several minutes of video feed starting in the middle of what appears to have been a live news report about a public celebration.\n\n§SLarge parades are carrying debris through the streets accompanied by cheering masses, until suddenly the atmosphere changes completely and panic spreads. Then the view is abruptly moved towards the darkening sky. A burning wreck draws a fiery line as it falls towards the ground. Before it reaches the surface, there are giant explosions all around and the video ends.§!\n\nThere is not enough material to translate what has been said, but [root.Leader.GetName] takes this as proof that [From.GetName] fell victim to ballistic bombardment by an alien fleet. Traces of a super dense compound spread across the planet's surface support this theory."
 
 #Anomaly success 2
 mem_antarans.203.name:0 "A Cruel Joke"
 mem_antarans.203.desc:0 "The investigation of [From.GetName]'s surface did not yield any conclusive insight. Yet it provided another mystery. Traces of a super dense not naturally occuring compound are spread across the planet.\n\nA real break through was made though when the [root.GetName] detected a hidden base inside a hollowed out asteroid orbiting [From.GetName]. The by our standards rather primitive facility is filled with basic stasis units housing thousands of dead beings.\n\nWhat our science team could find out by searching through the remaining data fragments stored in the facility's computersystem revealed a dire situation the inhabitants of [From.GetName] were facing. Their civilization had been attacked by a technological superior force multiple times in the past. Their growing resistence was met with increasingly brutal retaliations and they feared - rightfully as it seems - that their world would fall to these attacks. As a means to restart their civilization should the worst case happen this hidden base was installed to act as an arc to preserve the brightest minds and a necessary genetic variety to do so.\n\nHowever they had not expected their foes to turn their homeworld into a lifeless rock. The 'hidden' base appears to have been purposefully spared - given that we were able to detect it, it is to be expected their foe did too. As stated in the logs the stasis system shut down according to schedule ten years after contact with the surface had been lost. [root.Leader.GetName] cannot even start to imagine the dread and despair these people must have felt realizing their situation. Equipped with only two shuttle craft lacking FTL-capability and no world to return to they were stranded. Shortly after that the stasis system was reactivated indefinitely."
