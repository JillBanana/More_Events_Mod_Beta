 mem_antarans.201b.desc:0 "After studying what remains of this world chief scientist [root.Leader.GetName] and [root.Leader.GetHerHis] colleagues came to a concerning conclusion. Given all available information the current state of [From.GetName] is the result of cataclysmic orbital bombardement. In the vicinity of this site traces of superheavy elements unique to ANTARAN technology can be found. It appears as if they set an example here. No traces of a supposed civilization formerly native to this world can be found."

 #Anomaly success 1
 mem_antarans.202.name:0 "The End of a World"
 mem_antarans.202.desc:0  "While conducting a series of low altitude survey flights to study the crater sites using a shuttlecraft, our scientists received a weak self-repeating transmission originating from well below the debris. [root.Leader.GetName], though being able to pinpoint its source, quickly discarded the idea of trying to reach it as too dangerous.\n\nBack aboard the [root.GetName], [root.Leader.GetSheHe] managed to decipher the recorded transmission.\n\nIt consisted of several minutes of video feed starting in the middle of what appears to have been a live news report about a public celebration.\n\n§SLarge parades are carrying debris through the streets accompanied by cheering masses, until suddenly the atmosphere changes completely and panic spreads. Then the view is abruptly moved towards the darkening sky. A burning wreck draws a fiery line as it falls towards the ground. Before it reaches the surface, there are giant explosions all around and the video ends.§!\n\nThere is not enough material to translate what has been said, but [root.Leader.GetName] takes this as proof that [From.GetName] fell victim to ballistic bombardment by an alien fleet. Traces of a super dense compound spread across the planet's surface support this theory."
 
 #Anomaly success 2
 mem_antarans.203.name:0 "A Cruel Joke"
 mem_antarans.203.desc:0 "The investigation of [From.GetName]'s surface did not yield any conclusive insights. Yet it provided another mystery: Traces of a super dense compound not known to occur naturally are spread across the planet.\n\nHowever, a real breakthrough was made when the [root.GetName] detected a hidden base inside a hollowed out asteroid orbiting [From.GetName]. The facility, which is rather primitive by our standards, is filled with basic stasis units housing thousands of dead beings.\n\nSearching through the data fragments stored in the facility's computer system, our science team could piece together the dire situation the inhabitants of [From.GetName] were facing. Their civilization had been attacked by a technological superior force multiple times in the past. Their growing resistance was met with increasingly brutal retaliations, and they feared - rightfully, it seems - that their world would fall to these attacks. As a means to restart their civilization should the worst happen, this hidden base was installed to act as an ark to preserve their brightest minds as well as sufficient genetic variety to reboot their civilisation.\n\nHowever, they had not expected their foes to turn their homeworld into a lifeless and entirely uninhabitable rock. The 'hidden' base appears to have been purposefully spared - given that we were able to detect it, it is to be expected their foe did too. As stated in the logs, the stasis system shut down according to schedule ten years after contact with the surface had been lost. [root.Leader.GetName] cannot even start to imagine the dread and despair these people must have felt upon realizing their situation. Equipped with only two shuttle craft lacking FTL-capability and no world to return to, they were stranded. Shortly after that, the stasis system was reactivated indefinitely."
 
 #Anomaly success 3
 mem_antarans.204.name:0 "Ghosts of the Past"
 mem_antarans.204.desc:0 "During a more thorough survey of [From.GetName]'s surface, one of [root.Leader.GetName]'s assistants noticed what was later confirmed by our away team on the ground to be artificial structures.\n\nThe investigation of these ruins did not however progress as planned, mainly as a result of communications between the [root.GetName] and the scientists led by [root.Leader.GetName] being disrupted multiple times. Several personnel experienced what they described as psychotic episodes during these moments. Affected by this phenomenon as well, the chief scientist decided to return to the shuttle, fearing that remaining longer would put the team in danger. However, before they could lift off, another blackout occurred, lasting for much longer than any before that point. When communications could be reestablished, a very shaken sounding scientist reported that they are going to leave immediately. Half of them were still unconscious when they arrived at the rendezvous coordinates with the [root.GetName].\n\nAfter having recovered, [root.Leader.GetName] reports having experienced the collective death of an entire world at the hands of a merciless foe. According to [root.Leader.GetHisHer] theory, [From.GetName]'s inhabitants must have possessed extensive psychic capabilities, which led to their terrifying last moments being imprinted into the planet itself. Though physically unharmed, the events have had a lasting effect on [root.Leader.GetHimHer].\n\nFurther scans showed traces of a super dense compound spread across the planet's surface, which is likely to originate from the weapons used in its destruction, supporting [root.Leader.GetName]'s claims."

 #Anomaly 2
 mem_antarans_category_2:0 "Covered in Craters"
 mem_antarans_category_2_desc:0 "Scans of [From.GetName] are detecting suspicious crater formations and traces of the same super dense compound that is not known to occur naturally, but has been linked to multiple civilizational collapses on previously surveyed planets."

 #Anomaly success 4
 mem_antarans.205.name:0 "Suspicious Satellites"
 mem_antarans.205.desc:0 "Further investigation of [From.GetName] revealed that it had indeed once been inhabited but was rendered uninhabitable at the same time as a layer of super dense material was deposited on the planet, presumably the result of orbital bombardment. These events must have taken place many thousands of years ago, and remnants on the surface are too decayed and eroded to draw any further conclusions.\n\nJust as [root.Leader.GetName] was about to wrap up [root.Leader.GetHisHer] investigations, the [root.GetName]'s scanners picked up a set of tiny, suspiciously identical objects orbiting [From.GetName]'s moon. These turned out to be artificial satellites containing data cores. The chief scientist assumes these were meant to be found and act as some kind of time capsules.\n\nHowever, it will take significant effort to access and decipher the data stored within them."
 mem_antarans.205.a:0 "What do they contain?"

 MEM_ANTARANS_ANOMALY_PLANET_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "We have recovered data cores left in space when [From.From.GetName] was destroyed. Who knows what secret or message they contain?"
 
 #Project finished
 mem_antarans.206.name:0 "Time Capsules"
 mem_antarans.206.desc:0 "Our scientists have managed to decipher parts of the data cores. So far, it appears that each exemplar is an exact replica of the others and contains the same information - presumably as a strategy to increase the likelyhood of its preservation. The Data contained is extremely vast, and will take our scientists months, if not years to fully decipher.\nThe first entry, apparently a title page, has already been translated:\n\n'We thought ourselves invincible. We thought we could stop the 'Destroyers'. We were not a young race like the others they have brought down - we have travelled the galaxy for a millennium. But they have bested us. By the time this message will be found, nothing else will remain of our once proud race. We leave this record in the hope that our most prized treasure, the words of our greatest philosophers --- our cultural heritage, might outlive the extinction of our race.'"

 mem_antarans.260.name:0 "Suppressed Energy Transmission"
 mem_antarans.260.desc:0 "After running multiple experiments with the salvaged damper field generator our scientists got a solid understanding of its capabilities. Unlike our shields, which absorb energy of incoming attacks until they are depleted, the field this generator creates permanently supresses energy transmission so that only a fraction of it reaches the protected object.\n\nWhile it works against any kind of weapon, tests have shown it to be most effective against energy based ones. Though the application of this technology to our own fleet might seem tempting on the first look, our experiments demonstrated problematic sideeffects of this protective device. The supression of energy transmission is not limited on energy coming from outside its zone of effect but affects internal ship systems as well. So far no way of shielding them from the damper field's effects has been found.\n\nRegarding its underlying scientic principles we have yet to get a deeper unterstanding. However, this is nonetheless a significant step in overcoming the vazuran technological superiority and should improve our chances in battles against their ships."
