 MEM_PRIMITIVE_CIVIL_WAR_INTERVENTION:0 "Divine Intervention"
 MEM_PRIMITIVE_CIVIL_WAR_INTERVENTION_DESC:0 "One of our ships will provide the much needed assistance for the almost defeated rebels on [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] even though they won't understand what is going to happen. A few well placed shots from orbit should route the imperial forces with ease."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.name:0 "The Way of the Warrior"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.desc:0 "Our observation post orbiting [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] reports about an ongoing civil war within the leading [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] nation. All apparently started with the coronation of a young and progressive successor to the throne whose many reforms soon had far reaching impacts on his country's culture and society.\n\nWhile the [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.species.GetNamePlural] are still living in a quasi medieval era, their technological progress is much more advanced than this. Only strict adherence to tradition has prevented widespread application of many innovations so far. These changes were not approved by all of his subjects though. Especially the newly instated imperial army built of conscripts without regard to social class deeply offended the now obsolete noble warrior class.\n\nFacing their decline into irrelevance many of them rose up in defense of their ancient rights. But their chances of success are small despite their ability and experience as they are bound to their warrior code and traditions which forbid them to use the modern equipment the new imperial army fields.\n\nThe sword faces the gun."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.a:0 "Continue the observations."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.name:0 "Destiny Draws Near"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.desc:0 "The observation staff above [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] reports that after some initial success the rebels suffered a series of major defeats depleting their numbers and forcing them to retreat. It appears they have taken a defensible position to prepare for a last stand. The imperial army seems reluctant to attack for now realizing their tactical disadvantage despite having superior numbers.\n\nIn any case total victory of the imperial forces is just a matter when not if at this point as the rebels have run out of options. Or have they?"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.a:0 "They are surrounded and outnumbered. It is over..."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.b:0 "The only thing that could save them is "divine" intervention..."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.name:0 "Destiny is Here"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.desc:0 "The [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] rebel leader on [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] prepared his men for a final battle. He intended to go out in a blaze of glory rather than facing disgrace by accepting an offer of surrender sent by the emperor himself.\n\nTheir last charge ended in the crossfire of rapid firing guns, another innovation fielded there for the first time in [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] history. It was not a final battle but a one-sided slaughtering.\n\nNonetheless with the end of the rebellion on that day the last remaining staunch defenders of the old ways died and made way for the future. A brighter one, hopefully."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.a:0 "When the new meets the old it always ends the ancient ways."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.name:0 "Imperial Force Defied"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.desc:0 "Just as the rebel leader was about to begin his final charge into certain death the ground was shaken by [root.owner.GetAdj] weapon fire hitting close but still in safe distance to the besieging army not missing its intended effect.\n\nThe imperial army had been routed completely and the rebel forces stood victorious without any more loss of life. The message of a military leader who is apparently favored by the divine quickly spread across the country gaining him more support than his initial goal alone could have ever done.\n\nFacing the dwindling support by his people the young emperor was forced to come to terms with his opponents leading to a revocation of his reforms and an amnesty for the remaining rebels in order to save his rule.\n\nThe [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] civilization will stay medieval for the time being it appears."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.a:0 "Favored by the divine, huh?"
