 mem_boiling.1.title:0 "The Boiling Planet"
 mem_boiling.1.desc:0 "As deep probing has shown, [From.From.GetName] is not as "frozen" as we assumed. Its rocky part is actually extremely thin. Most of its mass is made up of water, with a highly active overheated core surrounded by extremely thin crust. This creates an extremely potent geothermal heater that boils water at the bottom, only to see it cool as it rises to the surface and freezes into a solid ice covering many kilometres thick."
