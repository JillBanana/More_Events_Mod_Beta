 mem_ark.2.name:0 "Space Oddity"
 mem_ark.2.desc:0 "Beside primitive civilisation living there, §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! something else has drawn our attention. \n\nAn orbital station is orbiting the planet, way more advanced than any technology natives have, yet way more primitive to be built by alien intelligence."
 mem_ark.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_ark.2.a.tooltip:0 "Construct an §SObservation Post§! above the planet or conquer it to find out more."

 mem_ark.4.name:0 "Something That Doesn't Belong"
 mem_ark.4.desc:0 "We had observed §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! for quite a while, and confirmed that the natives had no way of counstructing and launching a space station. \n\nSomeone else must've built it above their world."
 mem_ark.4.a:0 "We need to find more"

 mem_ark.5.desc:0 "Our settlers on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! confirmed presence of a primitive space station in orbit above the [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\n[mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] had no way of coustructing such a structure and the question is - who did?"

 MEM_ARK_PROJECT:0 "Investigate the Station"
 MEM_ARK_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A station above §Y[the_planet.GetName]§ looks distinctly out of place, orbiting a world centuries behind this level of technology."

 mem_ark.100.name:0 "The Ark"
 mem_ark.100.desc:0 "The system in orbit of [the_planet.GetName] turned out to be about 500 years old. \n\nFrom what the crew of [Root.GetName] could gather, the planet has actually experienced a nuclear war, or similar disaster roughtly at the time of station's construction. The species currently known as [mem_ark_grounders.GetName], are the descendants of survivors that underwent severe mutations, while last of the original species, called [mem_ark_sky_people.GetName] found refuge in orbit. \n\nLanding pods filled with cryogenic capsules and various equipment are still attached to the station, waiting for deployment. Seemingly, maintenance crew that was supposed to launch them had ran out of supply and perished before surface was deemed habitable. At this stage, any attempt to tamper with the station beside sending pods down would destroy it."
 mem_ark.100.a:0 "Launch the pods."
 mem_ark.100.a.tooltip:0 "A [mem_ark_sky_people.GetName] pop will be added to planet below."
 mem_ark.100.b:0 "Better not to touch anything."
 mem_ark.100.c:0 "Shut everything down and study the station."

 mem_ark.102.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Knowledge is Power"
 mem_ark.102.desc:0 "It appears that after initial tension between the [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] natives and the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] newcomers on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! they had finally acheived lasting peace. \n\n[mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] dazzled everyone with various technological gadgets, impressing scientifically-minded [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] enough for them to ask newcomers to become their new leaders."

 mem_ark.103.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Superior Firepower"
 mem_ark.103.desc:0 "After initial tension between the [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] natives and the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] newcomers on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! the conflict erupted into a full-blown war. \n\nHowever, no matter how many [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] warriors stormed the entrenched newcomers' positions, they were no match for autormatic firearms [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] brought with them. Eventually, natives had no choice but to surrender all power to the invaders."

 mem_ark.103.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Harmony"
 mem_ark.103.desc:0 "[mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] did not have much trouble integrating into [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] society on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. \n\nMost of them seem to be enamoured with simple and peaceful way of life [mem_ark_grounders.GetName] had developed and do not want to go back to technology level that brought ruin to their civilisation."

 mem_ark.104.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Gods from the Sky"
 mem_ark.104.desc:0 "It seems that the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] were quite lucky. [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] culture features imagery of pre-mutation [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] species prominently as a divine form or as saints who inhabited paradise lost. \n\nNow that [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] witnessed such beings in person, most have sworn fielty to them, calling them gods returned. Most [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] seem to be quite comfortable with this development."
