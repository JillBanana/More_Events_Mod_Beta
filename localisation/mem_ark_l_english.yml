 mem_ark.2.name:0 "Something That Doesn't Belong"
 mem_ark.2.desc:0 "Beside primitive civilisation living there, [the_planet.GetName] something else has drawn our attention. \n\nAn orbital station is orbiting the planet, way more advanced than any technology natives have, yet way more primitive to be built by alien intelligence."
 mem_ark.2.a:0 "We should find out more."

 MEM_ARK_PROJECT:0 "Investigate the Station"
 MEM_ARK_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A station above [the_planet.GetName] looks distinctly out of place, orbiting a world centuries behind this level of technology."

 mem_ark.3.name:0 "The Ark"
 mem_ark.3.desc:0 "The system in orbit of [the_planet.GetName] turned out to be about 500 years old. \n\nFrom what the crew of [Root.GetName] could gather, the planet has actually experienced a nuclear war, or similar disaster roughtly at the time of station's construction. The species currently known as [mem_ark_grounders.GetName], are the descendants of survivors that underwent severe mutations, while last of the original species, called [mem_ark_sky_people.GetName] found refuge in orbit. \n\nLanding pods filled with cryogenic capsules and various equipment are still attached to the station, waiting for deployment. Seemingly, maintenance crew that was supposed to launch them had ran out of supply and perished before surface was deemed habitable. At this stage, any attempt to tamper with the station beside sending pods down would destroy it."
 mem_ark.3.a:0 "Launch the pods."
 mem_ark.3.a.tooltip:0 "A [mem_ark_sky_people.GetName] pop will be added to planet below."
 mem_ark.3.b:0 "Better not to touch anything."
 mem_ark.3.c:0 "Shut everything down and study the station."
