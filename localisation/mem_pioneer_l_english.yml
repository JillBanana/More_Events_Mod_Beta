 # Anomaly Success
 mem_pioneer.1.name:0 "Extrasolar Probe"
 mem_pioneer.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] reports of the successful recovery of the object. On examination, it appears to be a weathered primitive craft designed for unmanned travel between stars. Likely, it was launched millennia ago and traveled through multiple systems at sublight speed until it was caught in [From.GetName]'s gravity. \n\nA plaque is mounted on the craft's hull, depicting odd geometric shapes, a scheme of an unidentified star system and a pictogramm of two nude members of a species unknown to us. Why would any civilization see fit to disseminate such information throughout the universe is unclear."
 mem_pioneer.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_pioneer.1.b:0 "They obviously want to be found!"
 mem_pioneer.1.c:0 "What a bunch of degenerates."
 
 mem_pioneer.2.name:0 "Cargo ship"
 mem_pioneer.2.desc:0 "The small craft recovered by [Root.GetName] turned out to be some kind of alien commercial courier ship. \n\nCrewed by two unidentified organics and a crude chemically-powered synthetic it was apparently transporting precious cargo when it was ambushed by pirates. \n\nThe crew seems to have perished in the attack and as the assaliants made away with the cargo, ship was left to drift aimlessly until it was caught by the gravity of the star."
 
 mem_pioneer.3.name:0 "Light military vessel"
 mem_pioneer.3.desc:0 "According to [Leader.GetName] estimation, the ship found by [Root.GetName] is a military vessel crewed by several distinct, unidentified species. \n\nAccording to surviving databanks, it was carrying valuable intelligence that would be instrumental in securing a military victory against some kind of "rebels", when it was ambushed in close proximity to [From.GetName]. \n\nIll-timed solar flare had caused fires all over the ship which crew tried to put out by depressurizing it, only to find their airlock control and life support system damaged by said fires. Unable to restore atmosphere, the crew perished leaving the hust of a ship drift aimlessly around the star."
 
 mem_pioneer.4.name:0 "Life pod"
 mem_pioneer.4.desc:0 "The craft [Root.GetName] recovered appears to be some kind of small life pod, carrying mummified remains of an alien youngling. \n\n\It appears, the pod was sent away from planet unknown to reach another one, presumably to escape some kind of cataclism and give its passanger a chance to live on an alien planet. \n\nInstead, the pod was caught by the star's gravity and orbited it ever since while life support system eventually failed. \n\n[Leader.GetName] noted an unusual genetic makeup of the passanger. Should it survive and mature, it could potentially become one of the strongest and most resilient organics without any kind of augmentation."
 mem_pioneer.4.a:0 "One less threat to worry about."
 
 mem_pioneer.5.name:0 "Individual travel machine"
 mem_pioneer.5.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] is not quite sure what [Leader.GetSheHe] recovered from the orbit of [From.GetName], but it appears to be some kind of sealed, self-propelling conical capsure made of an extremely durable material. \n\nOther unusual elements include a single optical sensor on a forward-facing stalk, a singular forward-facing gun and a manipulator of a sort. Inside the capsule apparently contained a tiny pilot compartment fit for some kind of small multi-armed being. \n\nAt some point in the past, it appearently went under attack with powerful blast hitting the sensor with fatal impact trasmitted to the pilot, killing it."
 mem_pioneer.5.a:0 "Whatever it was, it's dead now."

 # Anomaly Failure
 mem_pioneer.99.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_pioneer.99.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] regrets to inform that [Leader.GetSheHe] was unable to locate and recover the object. Whatever it might be, it is likely now lost forever."
