 mem_pioneer_category:0 "Possible Small Craft"
 mem_pioneer_category_desc:0 "Sensors indicate the presence of a small artificial object orbiting [Root.GetName]."

 # Anomaly Success
 mem_pioneer.1.name:0 "Extrasolar Probe"
 mem_pioneer.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] reports of the successful recovery of the object. On examination, it appears to be a weathered primitive craft designed for unmanned travel between stars. Likely, it was launched millennia ago and traveled through multiple systems at sublight speed until it was caught in [From.GetName]'s gravity. \n\nA plaque is mounted on the craft's hull, depicting odd geometric shapes, a scheme of an unidentified star system and a pictogramm of two nude members of a species unknown to us. Why would any civilization see fit to disseminate such information throughout the universe is unclear."
 mem_pioneer.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_pioneer.1.b:0 "They obviously want to be found!"
 mem_pioneer.1.c:0 "What a bunch of degenerates."

 # Anomaly Failure
 mem_pioneer.2.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_pioneer.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] regrets to inform that [Leader.GetSheHe] was unable to locate and recover the object. Whatever it might be, it is likely now lost forever."
 mem_pioneer.2.a:0 "Damn."
