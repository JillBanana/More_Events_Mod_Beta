 mem_visitor.2.name:0 "Impact event"
 mem_visitor.2.desc:0 "Our observation post over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! had picked a heat emission below that matches profile for atmospheric re-entry, followed by an impact on the surface. An asteroid small enough to slip past our sensors would burn up before hitting the ground and the fact that it didn't suggests that this event might not be natural. The impact occurred right outside a populated area with casualty estimate low to none."
 mem_visitor.2a:0 "We should recover it for ourselves."
 mem_visitor.2a.phile:0 "We should recover the object before it contaminate their civilization."
 mem_visitor.2a.phobe:0 "Savages should not be allowed to get this technology."
 mem_visitor.2a.tooltip:0 "Observation outpost crew will attempt to recover the object"
 mem_visitor.2b:0 "We should leave it be."
 mem_visitor.2b.phile:0 "What falls on their planet is their to keep."
 mem_visitor.2b.phobe:0 "Ignore the space garbage."
 mem_visitor.2b.tooltip:0 "Observation outpost crew will leave the object for natives"
 mem_visitor.2c:0 "Sterilize the area before it causes any trouble."
 mem_visitor.2c.tooltip:0 "Observation outpost crew will destroy the object with an orbital strike"
 
 mem_visitor.31.name:0 "Object secured"
 mem_visitor.31.desc:0 "The covert shuttle dispatched from the observation outpost over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! had successfully landed on the scene with special team retrieving the object before any natives arrived to see them. With the small artificial object safely in their hands, they departed hopefully unnoticed."
 mem_visitor.31a:0 "Good job."
 mem_visitor.31a.tooltip:0 "Object will be delivered to our homeworld for study"
 
 mem_visitor.32.name:0 "We are too late"
 mem_visitor.32.desc:0 "The team dispatched from the observation outpost over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! was too late. A group of natives had already made its way to the impact and left with a small unidentified object. To recover it now would expose our personnel to additional danger, and our entire operation to exposure."
 mem_visitor.32a:0 "We should steal it back."
 mem_visitor.32a.tooltip:0 "Observation outpost will dispatch a team to covertly recover the object from natives"
 mem_visitor.32b:0 "Fine, they can keep it."
 mem_visitor.32b.tooltip:0 "Natives will be allowed to keep the object"
 
 mem_visitor.41.name:0 "Successful heist"
 mem_visitor.41.desc:0 "Using satellite images our team successfully infiltrated the location where natives who found the object stopped for the night. Our agents successfully stole the object and left unnoticed, without causing harm on incident."
 mem_visitor.41a:0 "Good job."
 
 mem_visitor.42.name:0 "An Unfortunate Incident"
 mem_visitor.42.desc:0 "Our team successfully tracked down natives who found the object to a nearby settlement. However, during the attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives frightened by alien appearance. In ensuring fight most attackers were stunned and their memories wiped, however we can not be sure we have left no witnesses. The object, however, was successfully recovered."
 mem_visitor.42a:0 "At least we got some results."
 mem_visitor.42a.tooltip:0 "Object will be delivered to our homeworld for study, but natives might take notice of our actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!"
 
 mem_visitor.43.name:0 "Bloodbath"
 mem_visitor.43.desc:0 "Our team successfully tracked down natives who found the object to a nearby settlement. However, during the attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives frightened by alien appearance. Large number of attackers were killed in self-defence with the rest flee. It will be hard to contain the situation now with so many surviving witnesses and traces of carnage. The object, however, was successfully recovered."
 mem_visitor.43a:0 "Most unfortunate."
 mem_visitor.43a.phile:0 "Tragic."
 mem_visitor.43a.phobe:0 "And nothing of value was lost."
 mem_visitor.43a.tooltip:0 "Object will be delivered to our homeworld for study, but natives will most certainly take notice of our actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!"
 
 mem_visitor.44.name:0 "Mission failed"
 mem_visitor.44.desc:0 "Our team successfully tracked down natives who found the object to a nearby settlement. However, during the attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives frightened by alien appearance. Unwilling to harm their assailants the extraction team attempted to flee, resulting in death or injury of multiple agents, loss of the object and potentially disastrous information leak."
 mem_visitor.44a:0 "This is a disaster."
 mem_visitor.44a.phobe:0 "Was it really worth it?"
 mem_visitor.44a.tooltip:0 "Object will be delivered to our homeworld for study, but natives will likely take notice of our actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!"
 
 mem_visitor.45.name:0 "Mission failed"
 mem_visitor.45.desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the observation post personnel and recovery team, they have lost track of the objects. We will have to wait for it to resurface by normal means."
 mem_visitor.45a:0 "Most unfortunate."
 mem_visitor.45a.tooltip:0 "We will have to wait and see if the object resurface again"
 
 mem_visitor.5.name:0 "Sterilization"
 mem_visitor.5.desc:0 "A shuttle deployed from our observation post had deployed a medium-yield missile from a high altitude. It had hit right into the impact site of the planet. After the dust had settled, surveillance is no longer picking any foreign object on site and with any luck we should be able to pass this event for a second meteorite strike in the same spot."
 mem_visitor.5a:0 "This can happen, right?"
 mem_visitor.5a.tooltip:0 "Natives may or may not take notice of our actions"
 
 mem_visitor.52.name:0 "Sterilization aftermath: Religious development"
 mem_visitor.52.desc:0 "Our actions on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! were not unnoticed by the natives. Many took double detonation to be a divine sign and multiple places of worship popped up on the edges of the crater. Several religious cults based on the event are spreading across the planet."
 mem_visitor.52a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_visitor.52a.tooltip:0 "Our actions caused natives to become more §Yspiritualist§!"
 
 mem_visitor.53.name:0 "Sterilization aftermath: Alien plot suspected"
 mem_visitor.53.desc:0 "It seems authorities on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! had identified our actions as alien incursion. Not having full picture, they are blaming the double detonation on an unknown alien force and consider major inventions into defence industry and military organization to repel the expected invasion."
 mem_visitor.53a:0 "Worrying"
 mem_visitor.53a.phile:0 "What have we done!"
 mem_visitor.53a.tooltip:0 "Natives took action of our actions and are preparing to defend themselves from future incursions. This will make them more §Ymilitarist§!, §Yxenophobic§! or §Ymaterialist§!"
 
 mem_visitor.54.name:0 "Sterilization aftermath: Tension rising"
 mem_visitor.54.desc:0 "It doesn't seem that authorities on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! suspect any extraterrestrial involvement, but they do not buy the meteorite strike version either. Accusations of development and testing of weapon of mass destruction are flying and international tension is higher than ever."
 mem_visitor.54a:0 "Worrying"
 mem_visitor.54a.phile:0 "What have we done!"
 mem_visitor.54a.tooltip:0 "Our actions caused tension among natives to grow. This made them more §Ymilitarist§! and might lead to war between major nations in the future"
 
 mem_visitor.61.name:0 "Lost and never found"
 mem_visitor.61.desc:0 "It's been a while since the mysterious object made an impact on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§!'s surface and we didn't hear of it ever since. Our experts on the observation post firmly believe it was lost forever."
 mem_visitor.61a:0 "Much noise about nothing."
 
 mem_visitor.62.name:0 "Prophet from the stars"
 mem_visitor.62.desc:0 "It seems natives who recovered object are now revering it as some kind of divine messenger. We determined that the object is indeed speaking and possess a rudimentary AI, but its incoherent ramblings are impossible to decipher and fairly useless. What was its original purpose and where it came from remains a mystery."
 mem_visitor.62a:0 "But its effect on society is very interesting."
 mem_visitor.62a.tooltip:0 "With their newfound religious leader, natives become more §Yspiritualist§!"
 
 mem_visitor.63.name:0 "Alien menace"
 mem_visitor.63.desc:0 "The object that crashed recently on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! resurfaced again on a big presentation by one of the planet's governments. On the gathering of top scientific experts and leaders of major nations, it was unveiled as a definitive proof of alien life. The speeches made on the assembly had noted danger that discovery points to and what measures need to be taken to defend from it. "This changes everything, - the speech noted, - and we got to be ready"."
 mem_visitor.63a:0 "Worrying."
 mem_visitor.63a.phobe:0 "It won't save them."
 mem_visitor.63a.tooltip:0 "Natives are readying themselves to fight alien incursions. This will make them more §Ymilitarist§!, §Yxenophobic§! or §Ymaterialist§!"
 
 mem_visitor.64.name:0 "Alien teacher"
 mem_visitor.64.desc:0 "The object that crashed recently on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! was revealed today to general population by the planet's leading scientists. It appears to be some kind of interactive databank that is supplying them with advanced technology. The scientists cite this as a definitive proof of the benevolent intelligence waiting in the depth of space and urge people to invest into scientific progress to meet them among the stars."
 mem_visitor.64a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_visitor.64a.phobe:0 "How naive."
 mem_visitor.64a.phile:0 "We will be waiting."
 mem_visitor.64a.tooltip:0 "With alien knowledge spreading through their planet, native's advancement has been accelerated. With their newfound appreciation for alien knowledge they will become more §Ymaterialist§! or §Yxenophilic§!"
 
 mem_visitor.71.name:0 "Blank slug"
 mem_visitor.71.desc:0 "The object we recovered from the §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be less interesting than we hoped. It's definitely advanced and artificial in origin, but it is also a solid slug made of a supersolid compound. After eliminating all possibilities and not finding and cavities or other hidden compartments, we have to admit that we likely will never get much from it. The design of the slug and material composition had proven to be somewhat useful for our research."
 mem_visitor.71a:0 "At least we got something out of it."
 
 mem_visitor.72.name:0 "Maniac orb"
 mem_visitor.72.desc:0 "The object that crashed on the surface of §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be some sort of computer of alien origin encased in a spherical shell. We could not determine anything of its creators, but when we turned it on and established connection to some of our computers and produced a maniacal laughter and announced itself as our overlord, before realizing that it's plugged into a sealed wired network isolated from anything it can use to enslave us. It is now promising us great rewards if we plug it into a bigger network, but our scientists are not inclined to trust it."
 mem_visitor.72a:0 "Maybe we can figure out some kind of deal?"
 mem_visitor.72b:0 "Destroy the dangerous machine."
 mem_visitor.72c:0 "Destroy the blasphemous machine!"
 mem_visitor.72d:0 "Disassemble the device and study it."
 mem_visitor.72a.tooltip:0 "Our scientists will negotiate with the orb"
 
 mem_visitor.73.name:0 "Petulant orb"
 mem_visitor.73.desc:0 "The device recovered from §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be an alien computer of a sort, encased in a super-resilient spherical shell. The most notable trait of it is its talkative nature - it is vocalizing by normal means, but also broadcasting on multiple radio frequencies and flashing lights. The message deciphered is always the same - a demand to be returned into space on a loop. Many scientists however can't help but laugh at the device's petulant whining."
 mem_visitor.73a:0 "Send it back into space."
 mem_visitor.73b:0 "Broadcast footage of it live across the empire."
 
 MEM_VISITOR_SEND_ORB_INTO_SPACE:0 "Return orb into space"
 MEM_VISITOR_SEND_ORB_INTO_SPACE_DESC:0 "If the orb we got in our hands wants into space so much, we are happy to oblige. Since it doesn't have its own propulsion, we would need to calculate its trajectory more carefully than we had to for a long time."
 
 mem_visitor.731.name:0 "Sending orb into space"
 mem_visitor.731.desc:0 "We had commissioned a small civilian freighter to travel to the outskirts of our home system and jettison the orb away at escape velocity. It can now be expected to spend at least a thousand years travelling interstellar space without an incident."
 mem_visitor.731a:0 "Its determination is inspiring"
 mem_visitor.731b:0 "Never come back!"
 
 mem_visitor.74.name:0 "Knowledge bank"
 mem_visitor.74.desc:0 "The object we recovered from §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be a massive databank encased in a resilient shell. It doesn't contain any information about its origin, however someone put quite a lot of data into it with apparently goal to disseminate knowledge through the galaxy. Some of it is redundant to us and some of it is just plain wrong, but our scientists are already finding gems of knowledge that would take us into a whole new direction."
 mem_visitor.74a:0 "We could use it."
 mem_visitor.74b:0 "We don't need xeno science."
 
 mem_visitor.81.name:0 "No deal"
 mem_visitor.81.desc:0 "It seems that negotiations with the alien computer had came to a dead end. Frustrated, one of the scientists assigned to the project had smuggled some construction hardware into the lab and took his frustration out on it with a plasma torch. It is unlikely we would gain any useful intelligence from the puddle on the floor now."
 mem_visitor.81a:0 "This was really unnecessary."
 
 mem_visitor.82.name:0 "Deal with the orb"
 mem_visitor.82.desc:0 "Today we had struck a bargain with the alien device. In exchange for its cooperation with us we had hooked it up to an endless stream of gossip publications on the data networks from our empire and beyond. Its insights are already helping our military tacticians."
 mem_visitor.82a:0 "Good work."
 
 mem_visitor.83.name:0 "Orb has escaped!"
 mem_visitor.83.desc:0 "It seems the device we held in the lab had found a way to trick technicians into shipping it to parts unknown. One of the data terminals contained a note to "filthy peasants" (Presumably us) with promise to not destroy us as we can be instrumental in its plans. We already had found some influence in our systems leeching valuable data and processing power, but it is also providing some military information to our ships. Experts believe that it would not be able to cause lasting harm before it'ss located and removed, but it would take them time to do so."
 mem_visitor.83a:0 "We need to stop it"
 
 mem_visitor.84.name:0 "Maniac orb destroyed"
 mem_visitor.84.desc:0 "Today we had finally traced the alien device that attached itself to our data networks. The security force sent to unplug it was faced with threat of electrocution from local power grid, which encouraged them to use explosives to turn the orb into fine dust."
 mem_visitor.84a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 mem_visitor.91.name:0 "Mission aborted"
 mem_visitor.91.desc:0 "Since we no longer have an observation outpost above §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§!, we can no longer continue tracking the object that crashed on the planet recently." 
 
 mem_visitor_destroyed_the_machine:0 "Destroyed the blasphemous machine"
 mem_visitor_comedy:0 "Comedy gold"
 mem_visitor_knowledge_rejected:0 "Rejected xeno knowledge"
 mem_visitor_looking_at_sky:0 "Looking at the sky"
 mem_visitor_knowledge:0 "Alien knowledge bank"
