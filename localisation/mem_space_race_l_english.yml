 mem_space_race.1.desc:0 "An unusual idea had been proposed by some in our empire. In the interest of galactic peace and cultural and technological exchange, to organize a new galactic sporting event. \n\nThe "Space Race" will take form of a series of competitions set to determine most skilled pilots and engineers of the galaxy, by having small piloted crafts travel complex trecks through our space."
 mem_space_race.1.a:0 "Excellent idea! Send out invitations."
 mem_space_race.1.b:0 "No, it's a bad idea."
 
 mem_space_race.2.name:0 "Invitation to a Space Race"
 mem_space_race.2.desc:0 "Greetings. Perhaps you would be interested to know that we are organizing a sporting event and would like to invite you over. \n\nThis new event, a Space Race will involve variety of challenges to determine most skilled pilots and engineers in the galaxy. Would you like to come?"
 mem_space_race.2.a:0 "What a grand idea. Of course we will come."
 mem_space_race.2.b:0 "We'd rather not."
 mem_space_race.2.b.psycho:0 "Are you serious?!"
 mem_space_race.2.b.inwards:0 "We have no interest in your affairs."
 mem_space_race_must_be_diplomatic:0 "We are not interested in xeno diplomacy."
 
 mem_space_race.4.name:0 "The Race is a Go"
 mem_space_race.4.desc:0 "Enough foreign empires had expressed desire to participate in our grand new Space Race. We should begin the preparations."
 mem_space_race.4.a:0 "I can barely wait."
 
 mem_space_race.5.name:0 "Space Race Cancelled"
 mem_space_race.5.desc:0 "We could not find enough countries willing to participate in the proposed Space Race to make it worth the effort. The event had to be called off."
 mem_space_race.5.a:0 "Most disappointing."
 
 mem_space_race.6.name:0 "Preparations for the Race"
 mem_space_race.6.desc:0 "The Space Race is drawing closer and closer, just as we are preparing our racing crafts. \n\nThe race will be a showcase of the best technology [Root.GetName] and other empires can offer but limited size of the craft and rules of the race would force us to choose which of the system we should prioritize. Should we try and press our biggest technological advantage or try and compensate for our shortcomings? Or simply give everything equal priority and hope for our overall technological capacity to carry the day?"
 mem_space_race.6.a:0 "Give everything equal attention."
 mem_space_race.6.b:0 "Focus of shields."
 mem_space_race.6.c:0 "Focus of thrust."
 mem_space_race.6.d:0 "Focus on armour."

 mem_space_race.10.name:0 "Elimination From The Space Race"
 mem_space_race.10.desc.shield:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race took place in the proximity of the star, forcing pilots to rely on their shields to avoid dangerous solar winds and heat. \n\nUnfortunately, our craft was not able to take the heat and strayed too far away from the star, losing precious time on longer trajectory. They didn't make it to the finish line in time."
 mem_space_race.10.desc.thrust:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race involved long and complex trajectory around many different planets and other massive celestial bodies. \n\nIt seems our craft's engines were not powerful enough to maneuver in this area effectively, causing it to lose precious time in the gravity well after gravity well. They didn't make it to the finish line in time."
 mem_space_race.10.desc.armor:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race had took participants through thick cloud of space debris, forcing to rely on crafts' armour to avoid being disabled by collisions. \n\nOur craft braved the obstacle course for some time, until it was eventually damaged to such an extreme, it had to withdraw."
 mem_space_race.10.a:0 "Disappointing."
