 mem_rubicon.1.name:0 "Rubicon System"
 mem_rubicon.1.desc:0 "We have discovered large number of unfriendly vessels of unusual design, patrolling §Y[From.GetName]§! System that is filled with old battle debris. \n\nGiven provisionary name "§YRubiconids§!", they appear to be primarily concetrated around thick asteroid belt as if they are protecting something."
 mem_rubicon.1.a:0 "We should monitor the situation."

 mem_rubicon_core_category:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_core_category_desc:0 "A profile of a large inert vessel can be detected deep within the thich debris field."

 mem_rubicon.2.name:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon.2.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] had confirmed presence of an unknown vessel inside the thickest part of the planetary debris field. \n\nPreliminary observation suggests that it is parked next to a large rock and is for now safe, but due to hazardous environment, it would be impossible to safely maneuver outside."
 mem_rubicon.2.a:0 "We should keep monitoring it."
 mem_rubicon.2.a.tooltip:0 "Adds §S$mem_rubicon_hidden_ship$§! to §Y[From.GetName]§!: \n£engineering  Engineering §G+6§!. \nBuild a §Sresearch station§L over it to find out more."

 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship_desc:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the thick debris. \n\n§LBuild a §Sresearch station§L over it to find out more.§!"

 mem_rubicon.4.name:0 "Window of Opportunity"
 mem_rubicon.4.desc:0 "After observing §Y[From.GetName]§! for a while our scientists had formulated a plan to navigate the dense debris field and access the hidden ship. \n\nThis will be risky, but preliminary reports suggest highly advanced technology hidden there."
 mem_rubicon.4.a:0 "Make it happen."

 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION:0 "Concealed Ship"
 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION_DESC:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the debris field designated §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. With precise timing and agile navigation, we should be able to reach it."

 mem_rubicon.5.name:0 "The Worldmender"
 mem_rubicon.5.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] aboard [Root.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHerHis] team had successfully navigated the dense debris field in §Y[the_planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! and boarded the inert ship concealed in the midst of it. \n\nSaid ship is impressively old, with estimates ranging from thousands to hundred of thousands of years and most of equipment and data cores aboard had been lost to age and debris impacts. However, what we managed to gather is still quite fascinating. \n\nThe ship belonged to a civilisation that identified simply as §SMenders§!. The core tenet of their ideology seemed to be sense of "ecological supremacy", that is, they believed the natural ecosystem of their homeworld is superior to any other life. For generations, they had practiced agressive terraforming with wanton disregard for native life, often breaking down entire planet's biospheres and reforging them anew, and, at times, reforging planets themselves using fleets lead by so-called Worldmender ships. One of the civilisation that found itself in Mender's terraforming spree's wake had appearently relied on network of hidden heavily automated shipyards, and although their worlds have quickly been transformed into gardens of Menders' design, several such shipyards remained. \n\nA century or so after their masters' extinction, hordes of drones appeared at the borders of overstretched and complacent Mender Empire, overwhelming their fleets with sheer numbers. Menders who once wiped out their creators found themselves at mercy of the drones and soon were forced to retreat to a hidden base. Despite their best efforts, the enemy had followed them and destroyed the reminder of the armada. \n\nAs defeat seemed invetibale, the badly damaged flagship dived into the half-formed shell of a planet and remained hidden and operated by its caretaker AI. Unable to pursue, drones that will eventually be known as §SRubiconids§! kept vigil in the system. \n\nThe whole Worldmender is too damaged to escape, but parts of it might, with our help."
